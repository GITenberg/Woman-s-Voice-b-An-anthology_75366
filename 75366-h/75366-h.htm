<h2 class="nobreak" id="EDITORS_PREFACE">EDITOR’S PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>Just now, when the world is going through the
most significant period of human history, it is
well that woman’s voice be heard above the tumult.
For upon woman’s activity may rest the salvation of
the race.</p>

<p>This Anthology is not an attempt at literary effects
so much as it is an attempt to present seriously
woman’s viewpoint of life to a nation standing on
the verge of—it knows not what!</p>

<p>So new is the voice of woman in the affairs of
life, that in time of stress or panic it must become
insistent to be heard or heeded. One book, by one
woman, regardless of its strength or purpose, could
not have the effect that one book by “crowds” of
women could have. That is why this volume has come
into existence. It literally is the voice of “crowds of
women.”</p>

<p>Those whose words are quoted here are representative
women, leaders in their various organizations,
representing hundreds of thousands of individuals.
Many of them are among our foremost writers,
artists, teachers, actors, orators and organizers—some
of them combining several of these qualities.</p>

<p>“Woman’s Voice” might easily have been two
or three times its present size, but that would have
meant a publication too expensive to reach the thousands
of readers of moderate means to whom this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
work is an immediate, special appeal. Future editions
of this Anthology will be revised and enlarged
until we finally shall have a perfect volume which
will take its place in every home as a standard household
classic, along with those other books of strong
human appeal which every home possesses.</p>

<p>Much of the material in “Woman’s Voice” is
covered by copyright, and special permission has been
granted the editor to reproduce it here. Many very
good things were taken from exchanges (more or
less obscure publications), and in such cases the
original source of their appearance was difficult to
trace. However, in each instance attempt has been
made to give credit where it is due, and the editor
hopes she has made no serious failures in this respect.</p>

<p>The many publishers and publications, as well
as authors and artists represented here, have been
very kind in their co-operation to make “Woman’s
Voice” a success, by granting permission to use these
selections from their output. Special mention is
given them elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is the editor’s hope that this volume will circulate
very largely in the small towns and country
districts of our nation. I want the millions of women
who are feeling, and thinking, but who are as yet
inarticulate upon the larger affairs of life, to find
their need and their voice in this volume. I want
that great isolated sisterhood, many of whom have
never read a book by a woman on social questions, to
have this volume in their homes—and always near
at hand; on the sewing table, or in the kitchen cabinet,
where it may be referred to between cake-baking and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
bread-making times. I hope the children in these
homes will memorize the verses in this book, and recite
them at the Friday afternoon “Literaries,” in
their schools.</p>

<p>I hope the club women will make constant use
of this volume in their club work—in the preparation
of programs, and in roll calls. For the things
quoted here deal with the most vital issues of the
times, as well as with the most intimate personal
emotions and needs of the individual, and are presented
by responsible and capable women. Also, they
show the growth of race progress through woman’s
efforts—how she has struggled and won educational
rights; how she has struggled and won political
rights; how she has struggled and won matrimonial
rights, and rights for her children, and for the world’s
workers. How she is struggling still to bring about
an ever higher and fuller life for today and for the
future.</p>

<p>And in all this she needs your help, you in your
isolated corners; for not until every nook and cranny
is active and comes to the front, can our nation attain
to those heights for which our womankind is so
valiantly working.</p>

<p>When woman’s voice is heard the world around,
mankind will hearken to her cries and heed them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>

</div>

<p>The American people today may be likened to
the onlookers of a great drama. A drama so
tremendous, so spectacular, so tragic, that it surpasses
anything the mind of man has hitherto conceived.
The onlookers of this drama naturally are absorbed
with its immediate movements. With its broad meanings
they are intensely concerned, but beyond these
they have no interest. Their vision for detail is
clouded by the flare and vastness of the apparent.
What lies beneath, above, about, are only incidentals
and of no immediate consequence to them.</p>

<p>But the “incidentals” of the present war are, for
the careful observer, to say nothing of the professional
drama critic, the chips which show what is
taking place as the result of the flare and the noise,
and the tragedy. One of these incidents is the coming
of woman into realms of activity which not for
a million years—that is to say, never before—have
been opened to her.</p>

<p>Under the stress involved in winning a world
peace, this fact is scarcely noted, and is not understood
in its full meaning. But the moment peace is
declared it will become a question of vital importance,
involving as it does all lines of human endeavor—labor,
commerce, philosophy, literature, agriculture,
law, education, and the crafts as well as the arts.</p>

<p>The conservative mind, freed from the absorption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span>
of war, will turn with startled gasp to discover
that one half of the race has been shaken out of the
rut of ages, and is spilling itself helter-skelter, into
every department of social achievement. And the
conservative mind will ask with child-like frankness
if the women are equal to the responsibility and the
opportunity which has been thrust upon them.</p>

<p>“Woman’s Voice” has been compiled in anticipation
of this awakening on the part of the multitude,
as an answer to its wondering inquiry.</p>

<p>That women have themselves long yearned toward
the broader paths of effort and usefulness is
manifest in the utterances of those who have learned
the art of self-expression. That they fully comprehend
the meaning, hardships and blessings of the
broader life, is plainly shown in their wide-spread
printed word. “Woman’s Voice” is an effort to collect,
in what may be called at once a brief and an
exposition of woman’s entrance into the world of
general endeavor, the wisdom of the women who have
studied conditions with an earnestness and efficiency
which renders them peculiarly fitted to speak for
themselves upon the questions most closely touching
themselves and their children.</p>

<p>For ages untold only the voice of man has dictated
the conditions under which the rest of the world
should live, including women and children. All the
poetry, all the philosophy, all the wisdom of the ages
was presented in man’s words, and from man’s standpoint.
Woman, dumb, untutored, and handicapped
by an adverse public opinion, another creation of the
solely masculine mind, held to her chimney corner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span>
as helpless in the face of petty and colossal injustices
as the children she bore.</p>

<p>“Woman’s Voice” portrays the effort of women
to get away from this now apparent social mistake.
Women have spoken and will continue to speak, for,
if we are to proceed speedily and with the least possible
resistance into the new order of things, education
is still essential. There are millions to whom
the apparent is not apparent, and whose eyes must
be opened before the democracy for which the world
is paying in blood and agony can become a reality.</p>

<p>I believe “Woman’s Voice” should be in every
home in the nation, and in all nations where society
is affected by the conditions which have brought
women away from the hearth-stone into the market-place.
As a digest of the best thought of representative
women the world over, it will be read when the
multiplicity of volumes from which it is quoted are
passed by. It will be read not only for its seriousness,
but for its poetic sentiment, and its sprightly
comment on the every-day things of life. Its usefulness
to club members and to workers in the equal suffrage
campaigns will be invaluable, but it is to the
average housewife and mother that I trust it will
make its strongest appeal. To the women who have
more or less dimly felt, but who have not as yet
found a voice or an avenue through which to develop
or express this feeling about things which so much
concern them and their children. I am hoping, also,
that it will fall into the hands of thousands of theorists
who are opposing, for no reason except their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>
own ignorance about it, the advance of women in the
coming world-democracy.</p>

<p>Briefly, but earnestly, I wish to thank the publishers,
editors and writers who have made this Anthology
possible through their permission to reprint
from books, magazines and articles the matter contained
herein. I have endeavored in all instances to
give full credit to all of these, and if errors happen
to occur in this regard they are unintentional, and
only the result of the initial publishing of a work
as new and comprehensive as this one. Also, if any
name has been omitted whose observations should
have appeared in this book, it is only because it was
impossible for a very busy editor to fail to miss some
very worthy writers. In future editions these can
be gathered up, until we have a volume or many
volumes which may be perfectly representative of
the woman’s voice of the world.</p>

<h3>The Most Brilliant Period</h3>

<p class="author">By Anna Howard Shaw</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Former president of the National
American Suffrage Association. From a series of articles in “The
Metropolitan.”)</p>

</div>

<p>The winning of the suffrage states, the work in
the states not yet won, the conventions, gatherings
and international councils in which women of every
nation have come together, have all combined to
make this quarter of a century the most brilliant
period for women in the history of the world.</p>

<h3>Woman’s Awakening</h3>

<h3>Unanimity of Needs</h3>

<p class="author">By Katherine Anthony</p>

<p class="intro">(Author of “Mothers Who Must Earn,” and “Feminism in

</div>

<p>The woman movement of the civilized world
wants much the same thing in whatever language
its demands are expressed. In more or less unconscious
cooperation, the women of the civilized nations
have from the first worked for similar ends
and common interests. Beyond all superficial differences
and incidental forms, the vision of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
emancipated woman wears the same features whether
she be hailed as <i>frau</i>, <i>fru</i>, or <i>woman</i>. The disfranchisement
of a whole sex, a condition which
has existed throughout the civilized world until a
comparatively recent date, has bred in half the population
an unconscious internationalism. The man
without a country was a tragic exception; the woman
without a country was the accepted rule. The
enfranchisement of the women now under way has
come too late to inculcate in them the narrow views
of citizenship which were once supposed to accompany
the gift of the vote. Its effect will rather be
to make the unconscious internationalism of the
past the conscious internationalism of the future.</p>

<p>Not until the suffrage movement had awakened
woman to her responsibility and power, did she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
come to appreciate the true significance of Christ’s
pity for Magdalene as well as of his love for Mary;
not till then was the work of Pundita Ramabai in
far away India as sacred as that of Frances Willard
at home in America; not till she had suffered under
the burden of her own wrongs and abuses did she
realize the all-important truth that no woman and
no class of women can be degraded and all womankind
not suffer thereby.</p>

<h3>The Revolt of Women</h3>

<p class="author">“Ouida” in Lippincott’s</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_113">See page 113</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>The whole human race is involved in the results
of the present revolt and reaction amongst
women; if turned back upon itself by mockery it
will burn and bite on unseen, and find its issue in
mad sins, wild frivolity, and all the anarchy of
voluptuous abandonment; if rightly met, if rightly
guided, it may become the noblest and highest
revolution that has ever broken the chains of effete
prejudices, and let out human souls from the darkness
of ignorance into the light and glory of a day
of liberty.</p>

<h3>Women’s Qualifications for Suffrage</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Russell Sage</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_170">See page 170</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Twenty years ago I did not think that women
were qualified for suffrage, but the strides they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
have made since then in the acquirement of business
methods, in the management of their affairs, in the
effective interest they have evinced in civic matters,
and the way in which they have mastered parliamentary
methods, have convinced me that they are
eminently fitted to do men’s work in all purely
intellectual fields.</p>

<h3>A Generation Ago</h3>

<p class="author">By Neva R. Deardorf, Ph. D.</p>

<p class="intro">(Department Public Health and Charities, Philadelphia. From
“Annals of the American Academy.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Woman’s place in the crowd of a generation
ago was immediately back of her masculine kinsfolk.
Here she enjoyed protection from the rough
elbowing of the crowd, though in return for this
shelter she forfeited her liberty and was expected
to devote all of her physical strength and mental
energy to pushing some particular masculine protector
to the front. Some times her efforts were
appreciated, frequently they were taken for granted,
since etiquette favored a covert manner of pushing.
But the rules of the game have changed.
Partners and co-laborers are taking the place of
lords and masters. Farmers, professors, clergymen,
politicians, in fact, husbands of every calling are
coming to see the advantage of having a wife beside,
instead of behind, them. They now take pride
in a wife who enjoys an outlook on the world which
enables her to help far more intelligently and effectively
than did the wife of a generation ago.</p>

<h3>To Raise the Standards of Life</h3>

<p class="author">By Gertrude Barnum</p>

<p class="intro">(American newspaper woman. Speaker and writer in the
cause of organized labor.)</p>

</div>

<p>The attitude of men toward women, economic,
social, political, reacts upon man and society. In
recognizing this, the man with the scythe is a
length ahead of the man with the cap and gown,
the cassock or the check book. The awakening to
a sense of the economic interdependence and fellowship
of men and women, has made the trade unionist
the first to recognize the justice and wisdom of
“universal suffrage,” and annually in convention
the American Federation of Labor declares:</p>

<p>“That the best interests of labor require the
admission of women to full citizenship—not only
as a matter of justice to them, but also as a necessary
step toward insuring and raising the American
standards of life for all.”</p>

<h3>Legislative Responsibility</h3>

<p class="author">By Emily J. Hutchins</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_204">See page 204</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>The most obvious effect of the vote is that it
puts women upon a plane of political equality with
other normal adults.... Universal suffrage stands
for a certain recognition of the stake that all human
beings, irrespective of sex, have in the general welfare,
and destroys a false sense of sex limitations.
By virtue of their new standing in the community
women assume an equal responsibility with men,
for both good and bad legislation.</p>

<h3>He Shall See the New Woman</h3>

<p class="author">By Mabel Potter Daggett</p>

<p class="intro">(From “What the War Means to Woman,” in “Pictorial Review.”)</p>

</div>

<p>You see, when her country called her, it was destiny
that spoke. Though no nation knew. Governments
have only thought they were making women
munition workers and women conductors and
women bank-tellers and women doctors and women
lawyers and women citizens and all the rest. I
doubt if there is a statesman anywhere who has
learned to unlock a door of opportunity to let the
woman movement by, who has realized that he was
but the instrument in the hands of a higher power
that is re-shaping the world for mighty ends, rough-hewn
though they be today from the awful chaos
of war.</p>

<p>But there is one who will know. When the man
at the front gets back and stands again before the
cottage rose-bowered on the English downs, red-roofed
in France and Italy, blue-trimmed in Germany,
or ikon-blessed in Russia, or white-porched off
Main Street in America, he will clasp her to his heart
once more. Then he will hold her off, so, at arm’s
length and look long into her eyes and deep into her
soul. And lo, he shall see there the New Woman.
This is not the woman whom he left behind when he
marched away to the Great World War. Something
profound has happened to her since. It is woman’s
coming of age.</p>

<h3>A Woman’s Question</h3>

<p class="author">By M. Carey Thomas</p>

<p class="intro">(A contemporary. President of Bryn Mawr College. From an
address at the College Evening of the National American Suffrage
Association.)</p>

</div>

<p>Woman suffrage is first of all a woman’s question.
We cannot remain indifferent. The issues involved
are so overwhelmingly important, first of
all, to us as women caring as we must for all other
women’s welfare, and second, to us as citizens of
the modern industrial state. I am sure as the result
of repeated experiment that it is only necessary
for generous and unprejudiced women to realize the
present economic independence of millions of women
workers, and the swiftly coming economic independence
of millions upon millions more women
workers for woman suffrage to seem to them inevitable
from that moment.</p>

<p>No one can maintain by serious arguments—that
is, by arguments that are not pure and simple
distortion of fact—that the ballot will not aid
women workers, as it has aided men workers, to
obtain fairer conditions and fairer wages. All working
men and all men of every class regard the ballot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
as their greatest protection against the oppression
and injustice of other men. It is only necessary to
ask ourselves what would be the fate of any political
party whose platform contained a plank depriving
laboring men of the right to vote.</p>

<h3>A Prisoner in Bow</h3>

<p class="author">By Sylvia Pankhurst</p>

<p class="intro">(A leader of the Suffragette movement of England. The following,
quoted from “The Woman’s Journal,” is an account of
one of her imprisonments in the London jails.)</p>

</div>

<p>My eight days’ license had expired. The police
were massed outside the Bromley Public Hall where
I was speaking, waiting to arrest me. Numbers of
detectives in plain clothes within were amongst the
audience; the people hissed and howled at them and
they threatened them with sticks. At the close of
the meeting, the people, declaring that I should not
be arrested, crowded down the stairs and out in a
thick mass with men in the center of them all. The
police rushed at us, striving to break our ranks and
to force a way through to me.... Policemen were
on every side of me. Two of them gripped and
bruised my arms, dragging me along. The crowd
followed, calling to me.... The policemen dug
their fingers into my flesh. One of them took out
his truncheon and grasped it tight against my hand
and arm. The back of my left hand was bruised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
from it all next day. Several women rushed up to
me and were arrested, and one girl who did not
know any of us, or what the trouble was about,
called out: “Oh, you should not hurt her,” and was
taken into custody. They dragged me into a Cannon
Row police station....</p>

<p>So, hatless, and without so much as a brush or
comb, I was taken back to gaol to begin my hunger,
thirst and sleep strike. When I reached my cell,
the same cell in the hospital in which during February
and March I had been forcibly fed for five
weeks, I began to pace up and down.</p>

<p>A woman officer came to me and said I must not
make a noise.... I took a blanket from the bed and
spread it on the floor to deaden the sound of my
footsteps, lest any of the other women prisoners
should hear them and be kept awake.</p>

<p>Then I walked on and on, five short steps across
the cell and five short steps back, on and on, and
on.... As the hours dragged their slow way I
stumbled often over the blanket that wrinkled up
and caught in my feet. Often I stooped with dizzy
brain to straighten it. The walking, the ceaseless
walking, when I was so tired, made me grow sick
and faint. I was stumbling, falling to my knees,
clutching, as one drowning, at the bed or chair.
Sometimes I think I slept an instant or two as I lay,
for sleep seemed to be dogging as I walked.</p>

<p>It was cold, cold and colder, as the morning
came, as the sombre yellow faded and the gray
sky turned to violet—such a strange brilliant violet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
almost startling it seemed through those heavy
bars. Then the violet died into the bleak white chill
of early day.</p>

<p>In the day time I still walked, but sometimes I
had to rest in the hard, wooden chair, and then I
would be startled to feel my head nod heavily to one
side. My legs ached, the soles of my feet were
swollen. They burned, and I thought of the women
of the past who were made to walk on red hot
plough shares for their faith. After the first few
days I remembered that tramps rubbed soap on
their feet to prevent their getting sore. I rubbed
soap on mine and found that it eased them a good
deal. Each time I took my stocking off to do this I
noticed that my feet had grown more purple. My
hands, too, were purple as they hung at my sides.
My throat was parched and dry. My lips were
cracked. On Wednesday I fainted twice, and afterwards
there came and stayed till I was released, a
strange pressure in the head, especially in the ears.
There was a sharp pain across my chest. That
evening I asked to see a doctor from the home office.
On Thursday afternoon he came. On Friday there
was no more likelihood of my sleeping. I lay on
the bed most of the day burning hot, with cold
shivers that seemed to pass over me as though a
cold wind was blowing on my face. In the afternoon
I was released and came back to the little red-roofed
house under St. Stephen’s church and the
kind hearts of Bow.</p>

<p>Woman suffrage is a war on ignorance, prejudice
and vice. To attack certain gigantic forces, a
people must take any and every line open to them.
If the Germans had attacked Warsaw from but one
side, that great city would still be under Russian
rule. I believe, therefore, that women in fighting
for their suffrage should use all lines approaching
the enemy. I personally am working along all roads
of attack, for I feel that where one method may fail,
another may succeed.</p>

<h3>Feminism a Tree</h3>

<p class="author">By Beatrice Forbes-Robertson Hale</p>

<p class="intro">(Well-known English actress. Author of “What Women
Want,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from which the following is taken.)</p>

</div>

<p>... Feminism is a tree, and woman suffrage merely
one of its many branches. Some of these branches
are essential to the life of the tree, others are not.
Some grow strong and put forth shoots in their turn,
others blossom prematurely, wither young, and drop
from the trunk. Meanwhile the tree towers up into
the sun with its crown of sturdy growths, and its
abortive shoots lie forgotten in the shadow below,
leaving hardly a scar upon the great stem to mark
their death. Only few people see this tree as a unit.
All who do know that woman suffrage is one of its
essential growths. But the majority still concentrate
their gaze upon one branch or another, whichever
seems to them most fair, and the parent tree is lost
to sight amid the multiplicity of its offspring’s leaves.
Suffrage has rallied to its march thousands of conservative
women who are indifferent, or even opposed,
to some newer branches of the tree, while those who
are absorbed in certain later and eccentric growths
are sometimes amusingly contemptuous of the older
limbs. They forget that the topmost crown could
not flourish if the wide boughs below did not help
the tree to breathe. They are sometimes, too, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
danger of forgetting that if the great roots of the
trees were not anchored deep in the soil of woman’s
nature itself, in her motherhood, her strong tenderness,
and her service, the whole growth would perish.</p>

<h3>Woman Has Justified Herself</h3>

<p class="author">By Lady Morgan</p>

<p class="intro">(English. From “Woman and Her Master,” published in
Paris, in a “Collection of Ancient and Modern British Authors,”
1840.)</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding her false position, woman has
struggled through all disabilities and degradations,
has justified the intentions of Nature in her behalf,
and demonstrated her claim to share in the moral
agency of the world. In all outbursts of mind, in
every forward rush of the great march of improvement
she has borne a part; permitting herself to be
used as an instrument, without hope of reward, and
faithfully fulfilling her mission, without expectation
of acknowledgment. She has, in various ages, given
her secret service to the task-master, without partaking
in his triumph, or sharing in his success. Her
subtlety has insinuated views which man has shrunk
from exposing, and her adroitness found favor for
doctrines which he had the genius to conceive, but not
the art to divulge. Priestess, prophetess, the oracle
of the tripod, the sibyl of the cave, the veiled idol of
the temple, the shrouded teacher of the academy, the
martyr or missionary of a spiritual truth, the armed
champion of a political cause, she has been covertly
used for every purpose, by which man, when he has
failed to reason his species into truth, has endeavored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
to fanaticize it into good; whenever mind
has triumphed by indirect means over the hearts of
the masses.</p>

<p>In all moral impulsions, woman has aided and been
adopted; but, her efficient utility accomplished, the
temporary part assigned her for temporary purposes
performed, she has ever been hurled back into her
natural obscurity, and conventional insignificance....
Alluded to, rather as an incident, rather than
a principle in the chronicles of nations, her influence,
which cannot be denied, has been turned into a reproach;
her genius, which could not be concealed, has
been treated as a phenomenon, when not considered
as a monstrosity!</p>

<p>But where exist the evidences of these merits unacknowledged,
of these penalties unrepealed? They
are to be found carelessly scattered through all that
is known in the written history of mankind, from the
first to the last of its indited pages. They may be
detected in the habits of the untamed savage, in the
traditions of the semi-civilized barbarian! And in
those fragments of the antiquity of our antiquity,
scattered through undated epochs,—monuments of
some great moral debris, which, like the fossil remains
of long-imbedded, and unknown species, serve to
found a theory or to establish a fact.</p>

<p>Wherever woman has been, there has she left the
track of her humanity, to mark her passage—incidentally
impressing the seal of her sensibility and
wrongs upon every phase of society, and in every
region, “from Indus to the Pole.”</p>

<h3>The Story of Katie Malloy</h3>

<p class="intro">(Well-known as a speaker on the Socialist and labor platforms.
From a speech before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of
Representatives, Sixty-Second Congress.)</p>

</div>

<p>The need of the ballot for the wage-earning
woman is a vital one. No plea can be made that we
have the protection of the home or are represented
by our fathers or brothers....</p>

<p>What of the working girls, who through unemployment
are no longer permitted to sell the labor
of their hands and are forced to sell their virtue?</p>

<p>I met Katie Malloy under peculiar circumstances.
It was because of this that she told me of her terrible
struggles during the great garment workers strike in
Chicago. She had worked at H——’s for five years
and had saved $30. It was soon gone. She hunted
for work, applied at the Young Women’s Christian
Association and was told that so many hundreds of
girls were out of work that they could not possibly
do anything for her. She walked the streets day after
day without success. For three days she had almost
nothing to eat. “Oh,” she said, with the tears streaming
down her cheeks, “there is always some place
where a man can crowd in and keep decent, but for
us girls there is no place, no place but one, and it is
thrown open to us day and night. Hundreds of
girls—girls that worked by me in the shop—have
gone into houses of impurity.”</p>

<p>Has Katie Malloy and the five thousand working
girls who are forced into lives of shame each
month no need of a voice in a Government that
should protect them from this worse than death!</p>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Belle Case La Follette</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Wife of the United States Senator,
Robert La Follette. The following is from a speech on suffrage,
given in Boston.)</p>

</div>

<p>What is this government that we women have
been taught to think of as something so remote from
our interests, so unrelated to the immediate personal
preoccupations of our daily lives? There are three
great matters in which we are all concerned: religion,
education and government. In religion men and
women share equally (indeed, men sometimes are
content that women should do more than their share).
In education it has come to pass that both men and
women participate equally, though that was not always
so. It is less than two generations that our
universities and even our high schools have been open
to women upon the same terms as to men.</p>

<p>But government is considered as man’s exclusive
province—a limitation that has narrowed the lives
of the women, that has robbed the children, and that
has reacted most injuriously upon the State. For
with what matters does government concern itself?
Why, with matters that touch intimately home happiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and home prosperity, with laws and regulations
that guard and further human lives.</p>

<h3>Our Common Interests</h3>

<p class="author">By Lena Morrow Lewis</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Writer. Speaker. Former member
of the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party. Editor
“The Seattle Call.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Every argument in behalf of man suffrage
applies with equal force to woman suffrage. Men
and women have more in common as members of the
same species, belonging to the same human family,
than they have differences, because of the incident
of sex. To deny woman the ballot because of her sex
is virtually to repudiate her right and claim as a
human being. That a difference does exist between
men and women is on the other hand a strong argument
in behalf of woman suffrage. The giving of the
ballot to woman will not rob man of his just rights.
The admission of woman into the political arena will
do away with male supremacy, which is injurious to
man, breeds tyranny and results in injustice to
woman. Justice to woman does not mean injustice
to man. Our common interests as human beings,
and our differences as men and women both demand
political power and social rights for women the same
as for men.</p>

<h3>Allegory on Wimmin’s Rights</h3>

<p class="author">By Josiah Allen’s Wife
(Marietta Holly)</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. A philosopher who uses the humorous
story to carry her message to the reading public.)</p>

</div>

<p>“Wimmin haint no business with the laws of the
country,” said Josiah.</p>

<p>“If they haint no business with the law, the law
haint no business with them,” said I warmly. “Of
the three classes that haint no business with the law—lunatics,
idiots and wimmin—the lunatics and idiots
have the best time of it,” says I with a great rush
of ideas into my brain that almost lifted up the
border of my head-dress. “Let a idiot kill a man;
‘What of it?’ says the law. Let a luny steal a sheep;
again the law murmurs in a calm and gentle tone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
‘What of it? They haint no business with the law,
and the law haint no business with them!’</p>

<p>“But let one of a third class, let a woman steal
a sheep, does the law soothe her in those comfortin’
tones? No; it thunders to her in awful accents: ‘You
haint no business with the law, but the law has a good
deal of business with you, vile female; start for state’s
prison! You haint nothin’ at all to do with the law,
only to pay all the taxes it tells you to, embrace a
license bill that is ruinin’ to your husband, give up
your innocent little children to a wicked father if it
tells you to, and a few other little things, such as
bein’ dragged off to prison by it, chained up for life,
and hung, and et cetery.”</p>

<p>“‘Methought I once heard the words,’ sithes the
female, ‘True government consists in the consent of
the governed. Did I dream them, or did the voice
of a luny pour them into my ear?’</p>

<p>“‘Haint I told you,’ frowns the law on her, ‘that
that don’t mean wimmin? Have I got to explain
again to your weakened female comprehension, the
great fundymental truth that wimmin haint included
and mingled in the law books and statutes of the
country, only in a condemnin’ and punishin’ sense
as it were?’</p>

<p>“‘Alas!’ sithes the woman to herself, ‘would
that I had the sweet rights of my wild and foolish
companions, the idiots and lunys!’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ says she, ‘are the laws always just, that
I should obey them thus implicitely?’</p>

<p>“‘Idiots, lunatics! and wimmin! Are they goin’
to speak?’ thunders the law. ‘Can I believe my noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
right ear? Can I, bein’ blindfolded, trust my seventeen
senses? I’ll have you understand that it haint
no woman’s business whether the laws are just or
unjust; all you have to do is just to obey ’em. So
start off for prison, my young woman.’</p>

<p>“‘But my housework,’ pleads the woman.
‘Woman’s place is the home. It is her duty to remain,
at all hazards, within its holy and protectin’
precincts. How can I leave its sacred retirement to
moulder in state’s prison?’</p>

<p>“‘Housework!’ and the law fairly yells the
words, he is so filled with contempt at the idea.
‘Housework! Jest as if housework is goin’ to stand
in the way of the noble administration of the law!
I admit the recklessness and immorality of her leavin’
that holy haven long enough to vote; but I guess she
can leave her housework long enough to be condemned,
and hung, and so forth.’</p>

<p>“‘But I have got a infant,’ says the woman, ‘of
tender days. How can I go?’</p>

<p>“‘That is nothin’ to the case,’ says the law in
stern tones. ‘The peculiar conditions of motherhood
only unfits a female woman from ridin’ to town in a
covered carriage once a year, and layin’ her vote on
a pole. I’ll have you understand it’s no hinderence
to her at all in a cold and naked cell, or in a public
court room crowded with men.’</p>

<p>“As the young woman totters along to prison
is it any wonder that she sithes to herself—</p>

<p>“‘Would that I were an idiot! Alas is it not
possible that I may become even now, a luny? Then
I should be respected!’”</p>

<h3>For Woman Suffrage</h3>

<p class="author">By Jane Addams</p>

<p class="intro">(From speech favoring a suffrage amendment to the Constitution,
before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives,
Sixty-Second Congress. Prior to the enfranchisement of the
Illinois women.)</p>

</div>

<p>As I have been engaged for a number of years
in various philanthropic undertakings, perhaps you
will permit me, for only a few moments, to speak
from experience. A good many women with whom
I have been associated have initiated and carried forward
philanthropic enterprises, which were later
taken over by the city, and thereupon the women have
been shut out from the opportunity to do the self-same
work which they have done up to that time. In
Chicago the women for many years supported school
nurses who took care of the children, both made them
comfortable and kept them from truancy. When the
nurses were taken over by the health department of
the city the same women who had given them their
support and management were shut out from doing
anything more in that direction. And I think Chicago
will bear me out when I say that the nurses are
not now doing as good work as they did before.</p>

<p>I could also use the illustration of the probation
officers in Chicago who are attached to the juvenile
court. For a number of years women selected and
supported these probation officers. Later, when the
same officers, paid the same salary, were taken over
by the county and paid from the county funds, the
women who had had to do with the initiation and
beginning of the probation system, and with the
primary and early management of the officers, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
no more to do with them. At the present moment
the juvenile court in Chicago has fallen behind its
former position in the juvenile courts of the world.
I think the fair-minded men of Chicago will admit
that it was a disaster for the juvenile court when the
women were disqualified, by their lack of the franchise,
to care for it.</p>

<p>The juvenile court has to do largely with delinquent
and dependent children, and I think there is
no doubt that on the whole women can deal with
such cases better than men, because their natural interests
lie in that direction....</p>

<p>The establishment of a sanitarium for the care
of tubercular patients in Chicago was begun by some
philanthropic women, and later on, when these also
were put under the care of the city, these women were
shut out, save as they were permitted to do some work
through the courtesy of the officials. Sometimes the
officials are very courteous to them and glad to have
their assistance; sometimes they quite resent the suggestions
from them, claiming it is “up to” them to
take care of the city affairs, and that women are only
interfering when they try to help.</p>

<p>So, it seems fair to say, if women are to keep on
with the work which they have done since the
beginning of the world—to continue with their
humanitarian efforts which are so rapidly being taken
over by the Government, and often not properly administered,
that the women themselves will have to
have the franchise.</p>

<p>The franchise is only a little bit of mechanism
which enables the voter to say how much money shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
be appropriated from the taxes, of which women pay
so large a part. When a woman votes, she votes in
an Australian ballot box, very carefully guarded from
roughness, and it seems to us only fair to the State
activities which are so largely humanitarian that
women should have this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Woman on the Scaffold</h3>

<p class="author">By Alice Meynell</p>

<p class="intro-c">(English contemporary. Poet and essayist. From “The
Bookman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>See the curious history of the political rights of
woman under the Revolution. On the scaffold she
enjoyed an ungrudged share in the fortunes of a
party. Political life might be denied her, but that
seems a trifle when you consider how generously
she was permitted political death. She was to spin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and cook for her citizen in the obscurity of her
living hours; but to the hour of her death was
granted no part in the largest interests, social,
national, international. The blood with which she
should, according to Robespierre, have blushed to
be seen or heard in the tribune was exposed in the
public sight unsheltered by her veins.... Women
might be, and were, duly silenced when, by the
mouth of Olympe de Gougas, they claimed a
“right to concur in the choice of representatives for
the formation of the laws,” but in her person, too,
they were liberally allowed to bear responsibility
to the Republic. Olympe de Gougas was guillotined.
Robespierre then made her public and complete
amends.</p>

<p>The claims we make at these conventions are
self-evident truths. The second resolution affirms
the right of human beings to their persons and earnings.
Is that not self evident? Yet the common
law, which regulates the relations of husband and
wife, and is modified only in a few instances, gives
the “custody” of the wife’s person to the husband,
so that he has a right to her, even against herself.
It gives him her earnings, no matter with what
weariness they have been acquired, or how greatly
she may need them for herself or her children. It
gives him a right to her personal property, which
he may will entirely away from her, also the use of
her real estate, and in some of the states married
women, insane persons and idiots are ranked
together as not fit to make a will, so that she is left
with only one right, which she enjoys in common
with the pauper, the right of maintenance. Indeed,
when she has taken the sacred marriage vows, her
legal existence ceases. And what is our position
politically? The foreigner, the negro, the drunkard,
all are entrusted with the ballot, all are placed
by men higher than their own mothers, wives, sisters
and daughters!</p>

<p>The woman, who, seeing this, dares not maintain
her rights is the one to hang her head and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
blush. We ask only for justice and equal rights—the
right to vote, the right to our own earnings,
equality before the law: these are “the Gibraltar
of our Cause.”</p>

<h3>Man Cannot Represent Woman</h3>

<p class="author">By Rev. Antoinette Brown</p>

<p class="intro">(The first woman ordained to preach in the United States.
The following extract is from a speech delivered at the Suffrage
Convention at Syracuse, N. Y., Sept. 8, 1852.)</p>

</div>

<p>Man cannot represent woman. They differ in
their nature and relations. The law is wholly masculine;
it is created and executed by man. The
framers of all legal compacts are restricted to the
masculine standpoint of observation, to the
thoughts, feelings and biases of man. The law then
can give us no representation as women, and therefore
no impartial justice, even if the law makers
were intent upon this, for we can be represented only
by our peers.... When woman is tried for crime,
her jury, her judges, her advocates, are all men;
and yet there may have been temptations and various
palliating circumstances connected with her peculiar
nature as woman, such as man cannot appreciate.
Common justice demands that a part of the
law-makers and law-executors should be of her own
sex. In questions of marriage and divorce, affecting
interests dearer than life, both parties in the contract
are entitled to an equal voice.</p>

leading women to fulfill their peculiar duties is to
free them from all restraint by allowing them to
participate in the inherent rights of mankind.</p>

<p>Make them free, and they will quickly become
wise and virtuous, as men become more so, for the
improvement must be mutual, or the injustice which
one-half of the race are obliged to submit to retorting

<h3>The Call to Social Service</h3>

<p>The call to social service and action has brought
the modern club woman along an ever broadening
path to the high, wind-swept levels, where she
sights limitless opportunity for expression and
action; and two things she has come to see clearly,
first, that she needs the ballot to do this, her natural
work, more effectively; and second, that the Commonwealth
needs her.</p>

<h3>The Price of Liberty</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary Gray Peck</p>

<p class="intro">(In “Life and Labor.” Chairman Committee on Drama, General
Federation of Women’s Clubs.)</p>

</div>

<p>“I know not what course others may take, but
as for me, give me liberty or give me death.”</p>

<p>Patrick Henry, when he said that, was not
asking that liberty come as a free gift. No race or
class ever has attained it so cheaply. Fifty years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
after the battle of Gettysburg, the negro is still
fighting for the liberty which the bloodiest war in
history could not confer on him. He must get it for
himself.</p>

<p>Women have been fighting longer than that for
freedom.</p>

<p>It is the glory of the women’s labor movement
that working women struck the first blow for
women’s liberty in this country.</p>

<p>For a hundred years, working women have
made straight the way for all women to follow.
It was the women in the mills and the shops and
factories who made it possible sixty years ago for
women to enter the schools and the professions.</p>

<p>Today, in the ultimate analysis, it is the women
in the mills of commerce who gave women the ballot
in the suffrage states. It is they who are paying
the price. <i>Their strikes are all hunger strikes; not
a hunger for bread alone, but a hunger for life and
the liberty of soul.</i></p>

<p>Not till these strikes end in victory, not till the
last burning-factory martyr has rendered up her
life as a sacrifice necessary to the destruction of
the system which thrives on factory fires, can we
count the price which working women have paid to
make all women free.</p>

<p>“No people can long endure half slave and
half free.”</p>

<p>If the working women had consented to be
slaves, there would have been no woman movement.
More than that—without the woman’s trade unions
there could be no organized labor movement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Theirs is the strategic point in the conflict in which
the whole world is lining up. Around them will
rage the fiercest fight; but the stars in their courses
fight for them.</p>

<h3>Woman’s Right</h3>

<p class="author">By Olive Schreiner</p>

<p class="intro">(South African novelist. Contemporary. Author of “An
African Farm,” “Three Dreams in a Desert,” “Woman and Labor,”
etc. The following is from “Woman and Labor.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Thrown into strict logical form, our demand is
this: We do not ask that the wheels of time should
reverse themselves, or the stream of life flow backward.
We do not ask that our ancient spinning
wheels be again resuscitated and placed in our
hands; we do not demand that our old grindstones
and hoes be returned to us, or that man should again
betake himself entirely to his province of war and
the chase, leaving to us all domestic and civil labor.
We do not even demand that society shall immediately
so reconstruct itself that every woman may
again be a child bearer (deep and overmastering as
lies the hunger for motherhood in every virile
woman’s heart!); neither do we demand that the
children we bear shall again be put exclusively
into our hands to train. This, we know, cannot be.
The past material conditions of life have gone
forever; no will of man can recall them. But <i>this</i>
is our demand: We demand that, in that strange
new world that is arising alike upon the man and
the woman, where nothing is as it was, and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
things are assuming new shapes and relations, that
in this new world we also shall have our share of
honored and socially useful human toil, our full
half of the labor of the Children of Woman. We
demand nothing more than this, and will take
nothing less. <i>This is our WOMAN’S RIGHT!</i></p>

<h3>From “The Convert”</h3>

<p class="author">By Elizabeth Robins</p>

<p class="intro">(English contemporary. Actress, playwright, novelist. Author
of “Way Stations,” “The Convert,” etc. The following is from a
suffrage speech by one of her characters, Miss Claxton, in “The
Convert.”)</p>

</div>

<p>What, women don’t want it? Are you worrying
about a handful who think because they have been
trained to like subservience everybody else ought
to like subservience, too?... The women who are
made to work over hours—they want the vote. To
compel them to work over hours is illegal. But who
troubles to see that laws are fairly interpreted for
the unrepresented.... I know a factory where a
notice went up yesterday to say that the women employed
there will be required to work 12 hours a
day for the next few weeks.... Much of woman’s
employment is absolutely unrestricted except that
they may not be worked on Sunday. And while all
this is going on, comfortable gentility sit in arm
chairs and write alarmist articles on the falling
birth-rate and the horrible amount of infant mortality.
Here and there we find a man who realizes that
the main concern of the State should be its children,
and that you can’t get worthy citizens when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
mothers are sickly and enslaved. The question of
statecraft rightly considered always reaches back to
the mother. That State is most prosperous that most
considers her. No State that forgets her can survive.
The future is rooted in the real being of women. If
you rob the women, your children and your child’s
children pay. Men haven’t realized it—your boasted
logic has never yet reached so far. Of all the community
the women who give the next generation birth,
and who form its character, during the most impressionable
years of its life—of all the community, these
mothers now, or mothers to be, ought to be set free
from the monstrous burden that lies upon the shoulders
of millions of women.</p>

<h3>Rights, Privileges and Capacities</h3>

<p class="author">By Catherine Waugh McCulloch</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Former President Illinois Woman
Suffrage Association, and practicing attorney. The following is
from a pamphlet, “Illinois Laws Concerning Women,” issued by
the I. W. S. A.)</p>

</div>

<p>We read that no person shall be denied any
political rights, privileges, or powers on account of
religion. The word sex should have been added.
People may change their religion, but never their
sex. Rights, privileges and capacities ought never
to depend on color of eyes or hair, cast of features,
sex or any other accident for which a person is not
to be blamed and which a person can never overcome.
Any other qualification demanded of a voter
may be acquired by one’s own exertion, or the lapse
of time. Property may be earned, minority out-grown,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
education secured, sanity regained, alienage
removed, imprisonment outlived. But no industry,
no age, no brilliancy, no morality, can change sex.
Sex should be made less a disgrace instead of more
of a disgrace than poverty, minority, alienage, insanity
and criminality.</p>

pressing upon her more and more. Even the
mantle of marriage does no longer save her from it.

children destitute and hungry. She wants some of
the celestial promises to be realized here on earth.

over.</p>

<p>No wonder so few women had left an impression

with true genius, reach the highest order of development
while the character remained placid in its
willing dependence upon the reigning sex? And
man had despised woman through the ages, even
when most enslaved by her, knowing that on him
depended her very existence. He had the physical
strength to wring her neck, and the legal backing
to treat her as partner or servant, whichever he
found convenient.</p>

<p>“The woman’s place is the home.”</p>

<p>Such is a very common reply to those who propound
any new schemes for educating or helping

<p>By all means let most women choose the home

<h3>Woman’s High Achievement</h3>

<p class="author">By Selma Lagerlof</p>

<p class="intro">(Swedish contemporary. Prominent in literary and progressive
circles. From an address delivered before the Sixth Congress of the
International Suffrage Alliance in Stockholm, entitled “Woman the
Savior of the State.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Have women done nothing which entitles us to
equal rights with man? Our time on earth has been
long—as long as his. Have we created nothing of
incontestable worth to life and civilization? Besides
this, that we have brought human beings into the
world, have we contributed nothing of use to mankind?...
I look at paintings and engravings, pictures
of old women, of olden times. Their faces are
haggard and stern; their hands rough and bony.
They had their struggles and their interests. What
have they done?</p>

<p>I place myself before Rembrandt’s old peasant
woman, she of the thousand wrinkles in her intelligent
face, and I ask myself why she lived? Certainly
not to be worshipped by many men, not to rule a
state, not to win a scholar’s degree! And yet the
work to which she devoted herself could not have
been of a trivial nature. She did not go through life
stupid and shallow! The glances of men and women
rest rather upon her aged countenance than upon that
of the fairest young beauty. Her life must have had
a meaning.</p>

<p>We all know what the old woman will reply to
my question. We read the answer in her calm and
kindly smile: “All that I did was to make a good
home.”</p>

<p>And look you! That is what the women would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
answer if they could rise from their graves generation
after generation, thousands upon thousands,
millions upon millions: “All that we strove for was
to make a good home.”</p>

<p>We know that if we were to ask the men, could
we line them up, generation after generation, thousands
and millions in succession, it would not occur
to one of them to say that he had lived for the purpose
of making a good home....</p>

<p>We know that it is needless to seek further. We
should find nothing. Our gift to humanity is the
home—that, and nothing else....</p>

<p>For the home we have been great; for the home
we have been petty. Not many of us have stood with
Christina Gyllenstierna on the walls of Stockholm and
defended a city; still fewer of us have gone forth with
Jeanne D’Arc to battle for the Fatherland. But if
the enemy approached our own gate, we stood there
with broom and dish rag, with the sharp tongue and
clawing hand, ready to fight to the last in defense of
our creation, the home. And this little structure
which has cost us so much effort, is it a success or a
failure? Is this woman’s contribution to civilization
inconsiderable or valuable? Is it appreciated or
despised?</p>

<h3>Woman’s Sphere the Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Helen Keller</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_209">See page 209</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Woman’s sphere <i>is</i> the home, and the home, too,
is the sphere of man. The home embraces everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
we strive for in this world. To get and maintain a
decent home is the object of all our best endeavors.
But what is the home? What are its boundaries?
What does it contain? What must we do to secure
and protect it?</p>

<p>In olden times the home was a private factory....
Home and industrial life were one.... Once
the housewife made her own butter and baked her
own bread; she even sowed, reaped, threshed, and
ground the wheat. Now her churn has been removed
to great cheese and butter factories. The village mill,
where she used to take her corn, is today in Minneapolis;
her sickle is in Dakota. Every morning the
express company delivers her loaves to the local
grocer from a bakery that employs a thousand hands.
The men who inspect her winter preserves are
chemists in Washington. Her ice box is in Chicago.
The men in control of her pantry are bankers in
New York. The leavening of bread is somehow dependent
upon the culinary science of congressmen,
and the washing of milk cans is a complicated art
which legislative bodies, composed of lawyers, are trying
to teach the voting population on the farms.</p>

<p>It would take a modern woman a lifetime to walk
across her kitchen floor; and to keep it clean is an
Augean labor. No wonder that she sometimes shrinks
from the task and joins the company of timid, lazy
women who do not want to vote. But she <i>must</i> manage
her home; for, no matter how grievously incompetent
she may be, there is no one else authorized or
able to manage it for her. She <i>must</i> secure for her
children clean food at honest prices. Through all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the changes of industry and government she remains
the baker of bread, the minister of the universal
sacrament of life.</p>

house”, “<i>Bonne femme est oiseau de cage</i>”, “A wife
and a broken leg are best left at home”, were current
in every household, there was some reason why
women should remain at home. For <i>within the home</i>
were conducted—by women—all the industries of
life. In those days women not only made jams and
pickles, cured the hams and bacon, concocted wines
and medicines, they also designed and embroidered
all the curtains, tapestries and carpets; the making
of beautiful laces, the spinning, the weaving, the
sewing and the knitting of all the garments was committed
to the charge of women. In those days when
the control of all that made life worth living was
with woman, she did not need, nor did she seek, outside
occupations, which indeed consisted chiefly of
the less intellectual pursuits of hunting and fishing.
There was plenty of scope <i>within</i> doors for the intellectual,
industrial, and artistic faculties of every
active-minded woman. If it is true that woman was
more honored at that time when she remained indoors
than she is now, this was <i>not because</i> she remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
at home, but because all the arts and crafts
of life were in her hands—<i>within the home</i>. But now
all this is changed, through no fault of the woman
herself, and, except for the young wife and mother
who has plenty of occupation in the rearing of her
family, there is not enough work <i>within the home</i> for
additional active-minded and able-bodied women, the
numerous daughters, sisters, cousins, aunts, who
need occupation, but who have no family of their
own because there are not enough men to go round.</p>

<h3>The Poor and Good Housing</h3>

</div>

<p>Can children raised in Jail Bottom, whose only
outlook is a mountain-like dump of rotting and rusty
tin cans on the one side, and on the other a stream
which is an open sewer, smelling to heaven from the
filth which it carries along, or leaves here and there
in slime upon its banks, have any but debasing ideas?
Can parents inculcate high moral standards when
across the street or down the block are houses of the
“red light” district? Is the world so small that
there is no room left for the amenities of life? Are
ground space and floor space of more value than
cleanliness and health and morality?... It is certainly
a fallacy that the poor do not want good housing.</p>

<h3>Where She Lived</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. John Van Vorst</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary writer on Child Labor Problems.
The following is taken from her book, “The Cry of the Children.”)</p>

</div>

<p>The cotton-mill “folks” wear unwittingly a
badge which distinguishes them far and wide. As
I came along down over the hillside I met a child
holding in her arms another smaller child; both were
covered, their hair, their clothes, their very eyelids,
with fine flakes of lint, wisps of cotton, fibres of the
great web in which the factories imprison their
victims.</p>

<p>“Hello,” I said, “do you work in the mill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, meaum.” The voice was gentle and the
manner friendly. And giving a sidewise hitch to the
baby, who had a tendency to slip from her tiny
mother’s arms, this little worker showed me one of
her fingers done up in a loose, dirty bandage.</p>

<p>“I cut my finger right smart,” she drawled,
“so I’m takin’ a day off.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Tweaulve.”</p>

<p>“Got any brothers or sisters?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got him.... And I’ve got one brother in
the mill.”</p>

<p>“How old is he?”</p>

<p>“Tweaulve.”</p>

<p>“Twins?” I asked.</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head. “He’s
tweaulve in the mill, and he’s teayun outside.”</p>

<p>This little bit of humanity, taking a day off as
mother of a still tinier being, seemed a promising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
sponsor, and I suggested that we walk along together.
She could not go to the mill with me, she explained,
without first consulting her mother, so we proceeded
to the settlement in which she lodged, along with
eighty or a hundred families, who man the mill in
which she was a hand.</p>

<p>“That’s where we live.”</p>

<p>Her fleet little bare feet picked a way deftly
over the stony path, and she kept a hand free—when
it was not laid on the baby’s back—to point out the
turns in the road that led to “where she lived.” Her
home was one of a group of frame one-story houses,
perched on a slant of ground. Each house was encircled
by a wooden veranda, and the order of the
housekeeping described itself before the eyes, as a
whisk of the broom which carried all the dirt from
the kitchen onto the porch, and another whisk which
landed it on the slant of ground, bedecked, in consequence,
with old tin cans, decayed vegetables, pieces
of dirty paper, rags and chicken feathers.</p>

<p>It was to the more intimate quarters, however,
that I penetrated with my guide. The inside court,
or square upon which these “homes” opened their
back doors, was a large mud puddle overhung with
the collective wash of the neighborhood. In and out
of the mud puddle wallowed the younger members
of the mill families, receiving from time to time admonition
and reprimand from a gently irate parent,
who swished her long cotton wrapper over the court,
drawling to her offspring: “I sure will whip you if
you-all don’t quit.”</p>

<p>“That-a-ways where we live,” said my little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
companion, stepping onto the porch and depositing
her load, as she opened the door to announce a visitor
to her mother. The woman turned listlessly
from her sewing machine over which she was bent.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” she called to me, dragging
out a chair by the fire, without getting up.
“Lookin’ for work?” she asked.</p>

<p>I took a seat, glancing at the interior which my
little friend called “home.” The outer room was
a kitchen—though it might, except for the stove, have
been mistaken for a hen coop. The chickens pecked
their way about the dirty floor, venturing as far,
even, as the table upon which stood the meagre remains
of a noonday meal. The second and the inner
room had each a bed;—an unmade bed, I was going
to say, but how, indeed, could a bed be made without
either sheets or pillows? Two grimy counterpanes
were flung in disorder across the mattresses; a few
chairs, a bureau and the sewing machine completed
the house furnishings.</p>

<p>As the listless woman talked with me in a kindly
manner about work, the baby, who had crawled in
from the porch, and arrived as far as his mother’s
skirts, now tugged at these, to be taken up. His tiny
hands had served as propellers across the filthy floor.
The piece of lemon candy had added to the general
stickiness of the dirt, with which both hands and
face were smeared. As a soldier shoulders a gun—the
burden to which he is most accustomed—this mother
swung her baby into her arms, and, while she talked
on, giving items about the cost of living, and factory
wages, she loosened her cotton jacket—evidently the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
only garment she had on—and folding the baby to
her breast, she lulled its whimperings.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “we pay $1.50 a week for three
rooms. That’s a little over six a month. I call it
high. We don’t get no runnin’ water. Every drop
we use’s got to be drawed in the yard; an’ we don’t
get no light, either, nuthin’ but lamps.”</p>

<p>The baby, comfortable and contented, let his
hand stray over the mother’s throat, with little spasmodic
caresses which left in their trail smears of dirt,
flecked with tiny scarlet streaks where the sharp nails
had caught in the pale, withered flesh.</p>

<p>“I reckon you-all might be cold,” she said,
directing the older child to put more wood on the
open grate fire, thinking apparently nothing of herself.
“We don’t like it here first-rate. Maybe we’ll
move on. I sure do crave traveling. Well, honey,”
this was addressed to the baby, who had sat up with
a jerk and began to whine. The candy picked up
from the floor where it had fallen and restored to its
owner’s mouth, did not seem the desired thing. The
mother looked at me with a knowing smile.</p>

<p>“I reckon I can guess what ails him. He wants
his babies.” And at this, always without getting
out of her chair before the machine, she reached behind
her and drew from a shelf over her head two
white rats. These were apparently what the baby
wanted. In the game that ensued between him and
his pets, his chief delight seemed to be in seeing the
rats disappear through the open throated gown of
his mother, and making the tour of her bodice, wriggling,
burrowing, crawling, to emerge finally from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
her collar at the nape of her neck. Sometimes they
diversified their gyrations, proceeding upward into
her hair and down again by way of her ears onto
easier climbing ground. Impassable, unmoved, she
talked on in her gentle voice, giving no sign whatever
that she noticed the animals. It was only when
the baby plunged his short nails into the white rat’s
side that she ejaculated mercifully:</p>

<p>“Quit that! You-all ’ll hurt them babies.”</p>

<p>I was somewhat dazed as I proceeded presently
with my little girl guide from this interior to the
mill. The squalor and disorder of what I had
seen, the ignorance and the insensibility, contrasted
strangely with the courtesy that had been shown me,
the friendly concern about any intention I might have
to get work, the desire to help me on my way, the
strange lethargic tenderness which took the form of
pity for even rats.</p>

<p>“Like animals,” my friend had told me. That
we must wait to see.</p>

<h3>The War and the Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Jane Addams</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_28">See page 28</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>This war is destroying the home unit in the most
highly civilized countries in the world to an extent
which is not less than appalling.... At the present
moment women in Europe are being told: bring children
into the world for the benefit of the nation; for
the strengthening of future battle lines; forgetting
everything that you are taught to hold dear; forgetting
your struggles to establish the responsibilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
of fatherhood; forgetting all but the appetite of war
for human flesh. It must be satisfied and you must
be the ones to feed it, cost what it may; this is war’s
message to the world of women.</p>

<h3>The Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Laura P. Young</p>

</div>

<p>It is the home, and specifically the mother, who,
with taste and tact, experience and wisdom, and above
all, with love and faith, must guide and steady and
inspire these lives. If we want our boys and girls to
be free from discontent, free from hard commercialism,
free from vulgarity and false ideals, we must
enter their lives and quietly guide them into a youthful
brotherhood and sisterhood of service.</p>

<h3>Honest Partnership in the Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Fred Dick</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From speech before Congress on Welfare of the Child.)</p>

</div>

<p>The homemaking of the future ... must be
founded in this day and generation on financial independence.
The girl of the past used to go from financial
dependence in the girlhood home, to financial dependence
as wife. She now goes from the independence
of a wage earner to financial dependence
as a wife, which relationship creates friction, and
leads to incompatibility and divorce. There should
be an adjustment of the responsibilities of home life
before marriage on the basis of honest partnership.
The children coming into the home should be taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
into partnership financially and occupationally. They
should be paid for their work on the basis that “If
you don’t work you can’t eat,” and held responsible
for their share in the home-making.</p>

<p>Every home is perforce a good or bad educational
center. It does its work in spite of every effort
to shirk or supplement it. No teacher can entirely
undo what it does, be that good or bad. The natural,
joyous opening of a child’s mind depends on its first
intimate relations. These are, as a rule, with the
mother. It is the mother who “takes an interest,”
who oftenest decides whether the new mind shall
open frankly and fearlessly. How she does her work
depends less upon her ability to answer questions,
than her effort not to discourage them; less upon her
ability to lead authoritatively into great fields than
her efforts to push the child into those which attract
him. To be responsive to his interests is the woman’s
greatest contribution to the child’s development.</p>

<h3>Then—Back to the Home!</h3>

<p class="author">By Caro Lloyd</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary writer. Sister of Henry Demarest
Lloyd, and author of his Biography. The following was taken from
an article in “The Progressive Woman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Search any woman’s heart, no matter how
“emancipated”, how “modern”, she may be, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
you will find there the love of home, of a lover, of a
child, either realized or hoped for. How far this love
is being denied to women today needs no showing.
Women are being forced from the home into industry
at a faster rate than the birth rate. Those still in the
home are beginning to realize the interdependence of
the modern social order and to see that only by extending
their home-making out into the larger life of
the community are their own circles safe.</p>

<p>As they go out into this wider service and
struggle, women will take the spirit of the home with
them. There are already signs that the faith, honesty,
cleanliness, kindness of the home are to become the
qualities of future society. We are to forsake our
present régime with its cruel hostilities, and to build
an order which shall meet the needs of all its children
with the tenderness of father and mother, which shall
institutionalize sisterhood and brotherhood. In this
reconstruction women, the home-makers, will do a
valiant share.</p>

<p>Then, having battled for their emancipation and
won, and having used their new powers to join in
the crusade for a higher civilization and won, women
will go back into the home. Back to the home! But
it will be as free women to a free home, under whose
roof justice, equality and security will be sheltered.
At last there will be an era of peace, and the morning
rays of the golden age will tint the hilltops.</p>

<h3>Women’s Lodging Houses</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary Higgs</p>

<p class="intro">(English contemporary. Author of “The Master,” “How to
Deal With the Unemployed,” “Glimpses Into the Abyss,” etc. The
following extract is taken from the last named book.)</p>

</div>

<p>We sat watching until we were weary, between
11 and 12, and then went to our bedroom. The same
beds were reserved, and one woman who was said
to work for her living, and had a very bad cough,
was already in bed. We were speedily in bed also,
and for awhile were quiet. The room was very
stuffy, in spite of two ventilators; the sheets were
not very clean, but still fairly so. The beds were
filled by degrees all but one, that previously occupied
by the Scotch woman. One girl who came in
late said she was not on the streets; that she had
begged money for her lodging, as she was out too
late to return to her place. It was holiday time,
being Whit week. One girl came in late and had had
drink, which made her talkative, said she was a servant,
and had just left a place where she had been
ten months.... She meant to “enjoy herself” over
the holiday and go to service again.</p>

<p>One girl who had been in before grumbled that
her bed had been slept in and was dirty; but her
own underlinen was far from clean. No one seemed
to possess a nightgown; all slept in their underlinen.</p>

<p>We had the door a little ajar, and far into the
night the doorbell kept ringing, and girls were admitted,
and laughter and conversation drifted up
the stairs. Our room settled down sometime past<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
midnight, but the girl who was drunk several times
tried to begin a conversation. At last we all slept.
Two, however, had bad coughs. I woke at intervals
through the night, and finally at 6.30. I was longing
for fresh air, so put on a skirt and went down
to enquire the time, and decided to go out for a
quiet stroll. The bath room was empty, the bath
had old papers in it, and did not look as if it was
often used. There was a table with a looking glass,
and a good deal of rouge about. The wash basin
was very small, and no soap was provided. There
was a roller towel for everybody. We had learned
by experience to take our own soap and towel, and
we lent the soap several times....</p>

<p>I slipped out to the brightness of a May morning,
and walked in the direction of the park. The
park was not open, as it was not yet seven, but just
outside I found a resting place. What a contrast
to the fresh budding life of the trees was that perversion
and decay of budding womanhood I had
left behind me! A tree cut down in its prime to
make way for building furnished me with a parallel.
What <i>artificial</i> conditions of man’s making, are
pressing on those young lives, sapping them off
from true use to rottenness and decay?...</p>

<p>Is there even at the back an <i>organized</i> system,
seeking victims and preying on them? This much is
certain: that there is room for an allowance of greed
and wickedness against defenseless womanhood.
For if a woman cannot get work, where is she to go?
What is she to do? Can all our homes and shelters
together prevent many from drifting “on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
streets”? Do we not need a national provision for
migration, and temporary destitution among
women?</p>

<h3>The Inefficient Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Laura P. Young</p>

<p class="intro">(From a paper read at the Third International Congress on
“Welfare of the Child.”)</p>

</div>

<p>At present the chief reason I see for the fostering
of a recreative social relationship among high school
students is the inefficiency of the average home....</p>

<p>For instance, there is the home where the father
may assume the attitude that after working all day
at his own necessary pursuits, he cannot be annoyed
by a riotous lot of youngsters all over the place in the
evening. This is the short-sighted home....</p>

<p>There is the home in which the mother values her
housekeeping above her home-making, the mother
who cannot have her cherished lares and penates
marred or displaced by visiting young people or indeed
even by her own. This is the home of things,
not of children....</p>

<p>And an especially pitiful type of inefficient home
is that materially prosperous one in which the parents
are too absorbed in their own affairs, social and business,
to encourage home social life in their children.
This type flourishes in many so-called exclusive suburban
districts.</p>

<p>From whatever type of home a child goes to
school, it is in that home that his standards of conduct
and ideals of life are formed, and it is these that
he carries to his association with his fellow-pupils.</p>

</div>

<p>What is the relation between domestic service
and criminality and immorality? Between erring
girls and their own homes as nurseries of weakness
and wilfulness? It is this: housework as a sad
majority of women perform it, is the most unsystematized,
unstandardized, undisciplinary, unsocial
and uninteresting work in the world. And family
relations, as a sad majority of our citizens comprehend
them, are the most unregulated relations in
the world; there are a few standards below which
the social conscience of the community will not allow
a parent to fall in the treatment of a child, or a mistress
to fall in the treatment of a maid; but they are
standards so low that almost any other human relationship
is better regulated by law and by public sentiment.
The home is the most haphazard institution
of our day.... Of the twelve or fifteen million homes
in the country, probably not one million would pass
an efficiency test based on the way they are run and
the quality of their output.</p>

<h3>Market Value of Home Labor</h3>

<p class="author">By Helen G. Putnam, M. D., LL. D.</p>

</div>

<p>If the labors which the great majority of women
are putting in homes were estimated at market rates
like those of men—and domestic arts are coming to
have high values—husband’s incomes in a great
majority of cases could not secure either the quality
or the quantity. This, the largest single field of industries,
is not enumerated by the census. Accurate
valuation would put an end to the shibboleth, “The
husband supports the wife”; would give self-respect
to millions of women, and so inspire them; would remove
the unsound impression of women’s comparative
irresponsibility and men’s comparative dependability,
whose psychologic effect is disastrous.</p>

<h3>The Child at Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Elizabeth McCracken</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_90">See page 90</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>In one of the letters of Alice, Grand Duchess
of Hesse, to her mother, Queen Victoria, she writes:
“I try to give my children in their home what I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
in my childhood’s home. As well as I am able, I
copy what you did.”</p>

<p>There is something essentially British in this
point of view. The English mother, whatever her
rank, tried to give her children in their home what
she had in her childhood’s home; as well as she is
able, she copies what her mother did. The conditions
in her life may be entirely different from
those of her mother, her children may be unlike herself
in disposition; yet she holds to tradition in regard
to their upbringing; she tries to make their
home a reproduction of her mother’s home.</p>

<p>The American mother, whatever her station,
does the exact opposite—she attempts to bestow upon
her children what she did not possess; and she
makes an effort to imitate as little as possible what
her mother did.... Her ambition is to train her
children, not after the mother’s way, but in accordance
with “the most approved method”. This is
apt, on analysis, to turn out to be merely the reverse
of her mother’s procedure.</p>

<p>There is a rising revolt among women against
the unspeakable dullness of unvaried home life. It
has been a long, deadly routine, a life of servitude

honest woman will deny—man’s opinion is valueless
here—that there is nothing in the home alone to satisfy
woman’s human longing for variety, adventure,

<h3>Mother and Child-Character</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Winifred Sackville Stoner</p>

<p class="intro">(Of the University of Pittsburgh, and noted specialist in
Child Culture.)</p>

</div>

<p>As you know, the ancients believed that a
mother had a great deal to do with the character of
her children, and this is true, for no mother has
the right to bring children into this world and not
give them the best of care and attention. I believe
that every child born into this world has the trinity
of mental, physical and moral elements, and it is up

<p>I believe more good can be accomplished by
proper training right from the cradle than all the
corporal punishment in the world. I have ten rules,
and they are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>1. Never say “don’t.” The very atmosphere of
some homes is fairly reeking with “don’t”.</p>

<p>2. Never scold. A scolding mother is worse
than a spanking mother.</p>

<p>3. Never give corporal punishment.</p>

<p>4. Never say “must”.</p>

<p>5. Never allow a child to lose its self-respect or
respect for its parents.</p>

<p>6. Never frighten a child.</p>

<p>7. Never refuse to answer questions.</p>

<p>8. Never ridicule a child or tease him.</p>

<p>9. Don’t banish the fairies.</p>

<p>10. Don’t let a child ever think there is any more
attractive place than its own home.</p>

<h3>The Home of the Workingman</h3>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_203">See page 203</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>I look forward to a time I believe to be rapidly
approaching, when the home of the workingman, like
everyone else’s home, will be truly a home, the happy
resting-place, the sheltering nest of father, mother
and children, and when, through the rearrangement
of labor, the workingman’s wife will be relieved from
her monotonous existence of unrelieved domestic
drudgery and overwork, disguised under the name of
wifely and maternal duties, when the cooking and
the washing, for instance, will be no more part of the
home life in the humblest home than in the wealthiest.
The workingman’s wife will then share in the general
freedom to occupy part of her time in whatever occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
she is best fitted for, and, along with every
other member of the community, she will share in the
benefits arising from the better organization of domestic
work.</p>

<h3>The Hotel “Home”</h3>

<p class="author">By Edith Wharton</p>

<p class="intro-c">(Contemporary American Novelist. From “The House of
Mirth.”)</p>

</div>

<p>The environment in which Lily found herself
was as strange to her as its inhabitants. She was unacquainted
with the world of the fashionable New
York hotel—a world over-heated, over-upholstered,
and over-fitted with mechanical appliances for the
gratification of fantastic requirements, while the comforts
of a civilized life were as unattainable as in a
desert. Through this atmosphere of torrid splendor
moved wan beings as richly upholstered as the furniture,
beings without definite pursuits or permanent
relations, who drifted on a languid tide of curiosity
from restaurant to concert hall, from palm-garden to
music-room, from “art-exhibit” to dressmaker’s opening.
High-stepping horses or elaborately equipped
motors waited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan
distances, whence they returned, still more
wan from the weight of their sables, to be sucked
back into the stifling inertia of the hotel routine.
Somewhere behind them in the background of their
lives, there was doubtless a real past, peopled by real
human activities; they themselves were probably the
product of strong ambitions, persistent energies,
diversified contacts with the wholesome roughness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
life; yet they had no more real existence than the
poet’s shades in limbo.</p>

<p>Lily had not been long in this pallid world without
discovering that Mrs. Hatch was its most substantial
figure.... The details of her existence were
as strange to Lily as its general tenor. The lady’s
habits were marked by an Oriental indolence and
disorder peculiarly trying to her companion. Mrs.
Hatch and her friends seemed to float together outside
the bonds of time and space. No definite hours
were kept; no fixed obligations existed: night and
day floated into one another in a blur of confused
and retarded engagement so that one had the impression
of lunching at the tea-hour, while dinner was
often merged in the noisy after-theater supper
which prolonged Mrs. Hatch’s vigil until daylight.
Through this jumble of futile activities came and
went a strange throng of hangers-on—manicures,
beauty-doctors, hairdressers, teachers of bridge, of
French, of “physical development”.... Mrs. Hatch
swam in a haze of interminate enthusiasms, of aspirations
culled from the stage, the newspapers, the
fashion-journals, and a gaudy world of sport still
more completely beyond her companion’s ken.</p>

<h3>The Domestic Home Destroyed</h3>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_174">See page 174</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen how the ties of mutual interest and
common experience are disrupted by the transference
of industry from the home to the factory. We have
seen members of the family forsake the roof-tree in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
pursuit of work. We have seen the wife and child
receiving their pay from the corporation, in definite,
fixed wages.... The home shifts from time to time.
Light, food, air, space, all are inadequate or polluted.
The parents are irritable from the constant friction
and anxiety of the predicament in which they live.
Naturally, none of them can love “the home” very
deeply. The children feel little reverence for the
parents whose helplessness exposes the family to such
a life. There are few common activities and interests
between the members of the family, hence, there are
few strong ties. The companions of the alleyways
and streets form the social circle of the young, and
the cheap theatres which offer their attractions at
short intervals along the city streets fill up that
vacuum in their experience which the nature of man
abhors. Children living in these conditions do not
have a reasonable chance to grow up with strong
minds in sound bodies. Nor can this kind of youthful
life develop those ideas of fair and right conduct,
that honorable and dignified attitude of mind which
are essential to good citizenship. Born into such a
world, growing up in such an environment, why
should they respect anything or any body? They do
not. And the family disintegrates as soon as the
children are old enough to declare their independence.
Society has deprived the family of the means of
securing normal living conditions for its future citizens.
It is now confronted by the immediate and
urgent problem of providing those conditions outside
the family. The domestic home having been
destroyed, a social one must be provided.</p>

<p>This is so emphatically the children’s age that a
good many of us are thankful that we were not born
in it. The little girl who said she wished she had
lived in the time of Charles II because then “education
was much neglected” wins our sympathy. It
is a doubtful privilege to have the attention of the

<h3>The Nursery a University</h3>

<p class="author">By C. Josephine Barton</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_121">See page 121</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>If your child is rightly born, with no prenatal
drapery to untangle from, you need concern yourself
about his proper guidance, only past the infant
age. He will educate, without your insistence. He
will be showing you new points wherein your old
rhetoric is at fault, or your mental philosophy behind
the times. If you are wise, you will get vast lessons
from him.</p>

<p>Froebel said: “The nursery was my university.”
The child receives there indelible lessons,
nor does he judge as to whether a thing is literal or
figurative. It is all fact to him. Plato says it is
most important that tales which the young first
hear should be models of virtuous thought. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
highest and grandest that could be said of that
strange phase of human experience, the Flesh-birth
phase, was said by Friedrich Froebel, substantially
as follows: “With the beginning of every new
family there is issued to mankind and to each individual
human being, the call to represent humanity
in <i>pure development</i>; to represent man in his <i>ideal
perfection</i>.” Froebel was broad in saying also,
“The destiny of nations lies far more in the hands
of women, the mothers, than in the possessors of
power, or of those innovators who, for the most
part, do not understand themselves! We <i>must
cultivate women</i>, who are the educators of the race,
else the new generation cannot accomplish its task.”</p>

<p>Now Froebel was not contending for woman’s
rights, but for the <i>race</i>. He speaks of woman, because
he saw that <i>her element</i> in the cause of civilization
was in need of accentuation. He was seeking
in the race that <i>balance</i> which is imperative in the
promotion of perfect conditions.... Froebel spoke
of women because men have held the reins of education
in the past. Even in the matter of bringing
children into the world....</p>

<p>Above all things do not encourage the child to
occupy his time with trivialities, to the neglect of
the grand phenomena of nature—the beauty and
poetry everywhere, along the dewy borders of the
country road, the hedges and fields, the rocks and
imbedded fossils, insects and plants. To study
botany, geology, physiology and even psychology in
youth, is excellent occupation.</p>

<p>Children begotten under a sense of duty would ... be

<h3>Children Innumerable</h3>

<p class="author">By Florence Kiper</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The Forum.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Our age, it is true, is not a very reverential age,
a sceptical age, one questioning the traditions. It
is doubting the dignity in the lot of a soldier driven
to martial courage by conscription. It is finding
attenuated beauty in unwilling motherhood, though
submission be in the name of God or Social Duty.
It has asked itself this question and the answers are
perturbing—For what and for whom are we breeding
humanity if it be not for humanity itself?...
Indeed, it is unbelievable that there should be a cry
for breeding, when children innumerable crowd the
city slums, deprived of air and spiritual breathing
place, or in small towns and little farm houses grow
dull and vicious through lack of appeal to the imagination
and the intellect. Society as a whole cannot
be too thankful for those women, who, celibate
in body, have given themselves to the rearing of
this “child material below par”, in the belief that
the world is not for its superman but for the many.</p>

<h3>Quantity vs. Quality in Children</h3>

<p class="author">By Lady Grove</p>

<p class="intro-c">(English contemporary. From “Fortnightly Review.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Is not the quality, rather than the quantity, of
children the thing to be aimed at? If, then, by improving
woman’s status the breed improves, as improve
it must, is not this preferable to the “plenty”
in their present very mixed condition? Has no one
sufficient imagination to see in the mind’s eye a
race that would be incapable of breeding this mass
of “undesirable aliens”, who are tossed about from
shore to shore, welcome nowhere, and a curse to
themselves?</p>

<h3>Fewer and Better Children</h3>

<p class="author">By Helen Campbell</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The Arena.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Slowly, how slowly, has dawned the thought
that something more than mere numbers is the need
of the family. Man found out long ago what laws
must be studied and carried out in breeding for the
high results in animal life; the brood mare or other
animal rested and skillfully fed. For the woman,
such thought never entered the mind of either
husband or wife. The formula “God wills it”, lifted
the burden of responsibility for defectives, or diseased,
deformed or crippled children.... “Fewer
and better”, has its own mission, till the day comes
when a trained motherhood and fatherhood will
ensure to the state an order of citizens for whom
that war cry is no longer needed. The old phrase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
“God’s will”, is to fill with new meaning. God’s
will and man’s, more and more with every step forward
in the knowledge of what life was meant to
bring to every child of man.</p>

<h3>Equality in Fitness</h3>

<p class="author">By Helen G. Putnam, M. D. LL. D.</p>

</div>

<p>It makes no difference to the child’s inheritance
which parent is unfit. Neither should be. It makes
no difference to the child whether, after birth, the
ignorance, evil instruction, contagious blighting of
him come from a man or from a woman; from domestic
conditions (said to be women’s work), or
from municipal conditions (said to be man’s work).
The responsibility cannot be divided. Before this
ideal—the child’s well being—these sexes are on an
equal footing, nor is one sex justified in wronging
the child because the other says or does so. Nature
forgives no spurious reasoning. The child and the
race suffer the consequences.</p>

<h3>Reason and the Child</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary Wollstonecraft</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_121">See page 121</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Few parents think of addressing their children
in the following manner, though it is in this reasonable
way that Heaven seems to command the whole
human race:—It is your interest to obey me till you
can judge for yourself; and the Almighty Father of
all has implanted an affection in me to serve as a
guard to you whilst your reason is unfolding; but
when your mind arrives at maturity, you must only
obey me, or respect my opinions, so far as they coincide
with the light that is breaking in on your mind.</p>

<p>A slavish bondage to parents cramps every faculty
of the mind; and Mr. Locke very judiciously observes,
that “if the mind be curbed and humbled too
much in children; if their spirits be abased and broken
much by too strict a hand over them, they lose
all their vigor and industry.” ...</p>

<p>On the contrary, the parent who sets a good example,
patiently lets that example work, and it seldom
fails to produce its natural effect—filial reverence.</p>

<p>The Government’s interest in children shown to

be estimated.</p>

<p>America, which is the Mecca for every nation,
which has within its borders over 100,000 children
of foreign birth and one-quarter of whose children
are of foreign parentage, can claim a wider interest
in the children of every nation than can any other nation
on the globe, for within the boundaries of the
United States may be found children of every race

<h3>The Rising Value of a Baby</h3>

<p class="author">By Mabel Potter Daggett</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “Pictorial Review.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Only a mother counted her jewels yesterday, you
see. Today, States count them, too. Even Jimmie
Smith in, we will say, England, who before the war
might have been regarded as among the least of these
little ones, has become the object of his country’s
concern. Jimmie came screaming into this troublous
world in a borough of London’s East End, where
there were already so many people that you didn’t
seem to miss Jimmie’s father and some of the others
who had gone to the war. Jimmie belongs to one
of those three hundred thousand London families who
are obliged to live in one- and two-room tenements.
Five or six, perhaps it was five, little previous brothers
and sisters, waited on the stair landing outside the
door until the midwife in attendance ushered them
in to welcome the new arrival. Now Jimmie is the
stuff from which soldiers are made, either soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
of war or soldiers of industry. And however you look
at the future, his country’s going to need Jimmie.
He is entered in the great new ledger which has been
opened by his government. The Notification of Births
Act, completed by Parliament in 1915, definitely put
the British baby on a business basis. Every child
must now, within thirty-six hours of its advent, be
listed by the local health authorities. Jimmie was.</p>

<p>And he was thereby automatically linked up with
the great national child-saving campaign. Since
then, so much as a fly in his milk is a matter of
solicitude to the borough council. If he sneezes, it’s
heard in Westminster. And it’s at least worried
about there.</p>

<h3>Ideals of the Child</h3>

<p class="author">By Sidonie Matzner Gruenberg</p>

<p class="intro">(American Contemporary. From “Your Child To-day and
To-morrow.”)</p>

</div>

<p>We should make a special effort to discover our
children’s ideals, for several reasons. First of all,
by knowing what the girl or boy has nearest the heart
we shall be able to enter into closer sympathy with
the child, we shall be able to understand much of the
conduct that would otherwise baffle as well as annoy
us....</p>

<p>It is very easy to ridicule the ideals and ambitions
of children when they seem to us too high flown
or futile. But a person’s ideals stand too close to the
center of his character to be treated so rudely. It
is better to ignore the many trifling flights of fancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
that are not likely to have any permanent effect, and
to throw the child into circumstances that will force
the emergence of more deep-seated or far-reaching
ambitions.</p>

<p class="intro-c">(American contemporary. From “The American Child.”)</p>

</div>

<p>A Frenchwoman to whom I once said that American
parents treat their children in many ways as
though they were their contemporaries remarked,
“But does that not make the children old before their
time?”</p>

<p>So far from this, it seems, on the contrary, to
keep the parents young after their time. It has been
truly said that we have in America fewer and fewer
grandmothers who are “sweet old ladies,” and more
and more who are “charming elderly women.” We
hear less and less about the “older” and the
“younger” generations; increasingly we merge two,
and even three, generations into one.</p>

</div>

<p>A Japanese child is rarely punished and never
whipped, but the strong influence of the home training
makes the average child obedient and self-controlled
at a comparatively early age. He is taught to
conceal his grief with the thought that if he does not,
he will give pain to others.</p>

<h3>A Blot on Civilization</h3>

</div>

<p>Infant mortality is a blot on civilization. If it is
worth while to spend millions to safeguard farm products
which are, after all, only raised to serve the
needs of each generation of children in turn, is it
not worth while to spend the necessary sums to popularize
the methods by which the lives of children themselves
may be safe-guarded?</p>

<h3>Teaching the Child Citizenship</h3>

</div>

<p>One cannot begin too early to teach boys the
duties of citizenship. There are many men who are
educated, intelligent gentlemen who do not “take
the trouble to vote,” and are not ashamed of the
fact. When such things are true, is it any wonder
that we have cause to complain of corruption or misgovernment?
How can it be otherwise when some
of our citizens neglect their duty to their country?</p>

<h3>For Father’s Amusement</h3>

<p class="author">By Elizabeth Harrison</p>

<p class="intro">(Author of “A Study in Child-Nature,” “Two Children of
the Foot-Hills,” “Some Silent Teachers,” “In Storyland,” etc.
From “Misunderstood Children.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>I was strolling through a neighboring park one
breezy September day when it occurred. It took less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
than ten minutes from beginning to end—but did it
<i>end</i> then?</p>

<p>There had been a shower the night before, and
the city’s dust had been washed from the leaves on
trees and shrubbery. All nature seemed in fine mood
and had filled me, along with the rest of the town-imprisoned
mortals, with some of her exuberance and
life.</p>

<p>This keen enjoyment of mere existence, which nature
alone can give, was particularly noticeable in the
buoyant movements of a little three-year-old child,
who was dancing in and out of the shadows of the
tall trees, now running, now skipping, now jumping
in the joyous exhilaration of mere animal life. Ever
and anon he looked back at his father and his father’s
friend, who were strolling along in a more sedate enjoyment
of the fresh air and glittering sunshine. The
fact that each of them carried a tennis racket showed
that they, too, were out for a holiday.</p>

<p>The child’s delight in all the freshness and freedom
about him quickened his senses, as it always will
quicken a healthy child. In a few moments his attention
was attracted by the bending, swaying
branches of a nearby clump of willow trees. The fascination
of the lithe, graceful movement of the boughs
was so strong that he stooped and stood with upturned
face, gazing at them until the two men approached
him. Then catching hold of his father’s hand he exclaimed,
“See! See!” pointing to the nodding tree
branches. His face was full of happiness, and his
eyes were looking into his father’s eyes expecting
sympathy in this new-found wonder of nature. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the father gave no heed to what was interesting the
boy. Instead, he began playfully slapping him on his
skirts with the tennis racket, at the same time saying,
“Will you be good?” “No,” answered the child
in high glee. It was evidently a familiar pastime between
them. “Will you be good?” repeated the
father, in mock threat lifting the tennis racket as if
to strike the child over the head. “No, I won’t! No,
I won’t!” shouted the boy as he scampered off over
the grass. This created a chase in which the father
playfully spanked the captured boy as with make-believe
wrath he dragged him back to the side-walk.
Having returned to the starting point of the chase he
released the boy with the words, “There now, I’ll
spank you hard if you are not a good boy!” He had
scarcely let go his hold on the youngster’s arm before
the latter again ran off, shouting in high glee,
“No, I won’t! No, I won’t be good!” Again came
the chase and again the playful spanking and dragging
back and the release with an admonition that
he would get a beating this time if he was not a good
boy. The tone in which the words were said were an
invitation to the child to renew the game.</p>

<p>The third time he started off, however, the other
man decided that he, too, would take part in the sport.
So he quickly put his tennis racket in front of the
boy, thus obstructing his path. The child manfully
struggled to push it aside, but could not. Soon his
“No, I won’t,” in answer to his father’s “Will you be
good?” had in it a note of fretfulness or, rather, resentment.
He was contending now with two grown
men and his strength was not equal to the strain. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
pushed angrily against the racket in front while trying
at the same time to avoid the light blows from the
one in the rear. With cat-like agility the man in
front would withdraw his obstructing tennis racket
until the boy started forward and then check—would
come the racket just in front of him. The very
movement of his arm was like that of a cat regaining
his hold on an escaping mouse. A peal of laughter
from him each time he caught the exasperated child
showed how much he was enjoying the sport. The
father seemed equally amused and joined heartily in
thwarting the efforts of the boy to escape. The little
fellow’s face grew red, and he was soon short of
breath from his struggles, and there was the angry
sob of defeat in his voice. The scene ended by the
child’s getting into a towering rage.</p>

<p>When they passed out of sight the father had
seized him by the arm and was forcing him along, the
boy kicking and struggling, but powerless to help himself.
The two men were laughing heartily.</p>

<p>The child’s blood had been poisoned by the heat
of anger, he had exhausted his physical vitality and
his nervous system had been disarranged, not to
speak of his moral standards—but then, the father
and his friend had been amused.</p>

<h3>The Cotton-Mill Child</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. John Van Vorst</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The Cry of the Children.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>)</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_57">See page 57</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>The first child to whom I spoke stood waiting,
without work, for the machinery to start up. He had
on a cloth cap, overalls, and a blue cotton shirt open
at the throat. His face was wan, his eyes blue,
with an intense blue streak beneath them. His mouth
was full of tobacco, which had collected in a
dingy crust about his lips. As he leaned back, one
foot crossed over the other, expectant for the
spindles to begin their whirling, he presented in his
attitude and gestures, the appearance, not of a child,
but of a gaunt man shrunk to diminutive size. Going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
over to where he sat, I started conversation with
him about his work.</p>

<p>“How many sides do you run a day?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Three to four,” he answered.</p>

<p>“How much do you make?”</p>

<p>“About $2.40 a week.”</p>

<p>Then hastily I put the question: “How old are
you!”</p>

<p>“Goin’ on tweayulve,” he responded. “I’ve
been workin’ about four years. I come in here when
I was seayvun.”</p>

<p>“Ever been to school?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “No, meayum. I don’t
know if I would like it. I reckon I’d as soon work
here as be in school.”</p>

<p>“How many hours do you work here a day!”</p>

<p>“From six until six.”</p>

<p>The noise of the machine was distracting, and as
I bent over him to catch his answer piped in a shrill,
nasal voice, I could not but notice how fine and delicate
his features were; the deep eyes, the high arched
nose, the slender lips were placed in the oval face as
features only can be placed by the unerring mold that
breeding casts. Observing, also, the miniature
shoulders that seemed to have been oppressed by
some iron hand, I said:</p>

<p>“Don’t you get very tired?”</p>

<p>There was a pause which made more marked the
honesty of his response.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t never pay much attention
whether I get tired or not.”</p>

<p>“You have an hour at noon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>Here he brushed the cloth cap onto the back of
his head, and sent a long, wet, black line from his
mouth to the floor.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said (it was the man who spoke, his
arms akimbo, his body warped in the long tussle for
existence), “they aim to give us an hour, but we don’t
never get more’n twenty-five minutes. We all live
right up there.” He nodded toward the square of
houses clustered around the mud-puddle on the brink
of the slovenly hillside. Then the bobbins began to
revolve slowly, and the boy started back to his work.</p>

<p>“You can’t loaf much,” he explained, “when the
machine’s a runnin’.”</p>

<p>Up and down he plied on his monotonous beat—lone
little figure....</p>

<p>Evidently waiting to join in the conversation, a
small boy, I noticed, was standing beside me. His
dark eyes sparkled merrily in his colorless face; he
was dirty and covered with lint.</p>

<p>“What’s your job?”</p>

<p>“Sweepin’,” he grinned.</p>

<p>“How much do you make a day!”</p>

<p>“Twenty cents.”</p>

<p>“How old are you!”</p>

<p>“Seayvun.”</p>

<p>The boy at the machine, making bands for the
spindles, was “goin’ on tayun.” He earned twenty
cents a day. Others, I learned, were eight, nine and
ten, and occasionally there was one as old as twelve.</p>

<p>As I walked on now through the mills talking
with a twelve-year-old red-headed girl who had been
four years at work, my eyes suddenly fell upon a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
strange couple. I could not take my attention from
the tinier of the tiny pair; the boy’s hands appeared
to be made without bones, his thumb flew back almost
double as he pressed the cotton to loosen it from the
revolving roller in the spinning frame; they no longer
moved, these yellow, anemic hands, as though directed
in their different acts by a thinking intelligence; they
performed mechanically the gestures which had given
them their definite form.</p>

<p>The red-headed girl laughed and nodded in the
direction of the dwarfs.</p>

<p>“He’s most six,” she said. “He’s been here two
years. He come in when he was most four. His little
brother most four’s workin’ here now.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Where?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he works on the night shift. He comes in
’beaout half-a-past five and stays till six in the
mornin’.”</p>

<p>I went over to the other dwarf of the couple,
older, evidently, than the boy “most six.” Below
her red cotton frock hung a long apron which reached
to the ground. Her hair was short and shaggy, her
face bloated, her eyes like a depression in the flesh,
and about her mouth trailed streaks of tobacco. It
seemed absurd to question her. Oblivion was the
only thing that could have been mercifully tendered—even
the peace of death could hardly have relaxed
those tense features, cast in the dogged mould
of suffering.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” I asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What do you earn?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>She shook her head again.</p>

<p>Her fingers did not for a moment stop in their
swift manipulation of the broken thread. Then, as
if she had suddenly remembered something, she
said:</p>

<p>“I’ve only been workin’ here a day.”</p>

<p>“Only one day?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been on the night shift till neow.”</p>

<p>Dwarfs? Ah, yes; dwarfs indeed. But would
that those who affirm it might catch sight of the expression
that lowered under the brows of those two
miniature victims. Like a menace, threatening, terrible,
it seemed to presage the storm that shall one day
be unchained by the spirits too long pent up in service
to the greed of man.</p>

<h3>Need the Vote for the Children</h3>

<p class="author">By M. Carey Thomas</p>

</div>

<p>Women need a vote for the sake of children. No
state, modern or ancient, has ever cared properly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
for its children. Children are at the present time
horribly neglected in every country, even when they
are not, as in many states of the United States,
horribly abused. All women whatever their nationality
care more than all men for the welfare of all
children. This is true even of female animals in the
animal world. It is supremely true in our human
world. Children are, and always will be, the special
interest of women. Wherever women already vote,
their influence is felt immediately and persistently in
ameliorative measures for the protection, reformation,
and education of little children. No one with
any knowledge of the facts can deny that the
political power of women is exercised on behalf of
children. We are now learning that children should
be the chief concern of our present civilization because
in them lies the hope of the future. For the
sake of children, women must vote.</p>

<h3>The Mother</h3>

<p class="author">By Marion Harland</p>

<p class="intro">(Well-known magazine writer. The following is from “The
Independent.”)</p>

</div>

<p>She has never ceased out of the land. That
she seems to be more in evidence now than she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
sixty years ago may be but one more expression
of Feminism....</p>

<p>In every well-appointed household the mother
is the controlling influence. In a large percentage
of homes her acknowledged sovereignty is a dictatorship.
If she be a woman of intelligence and refinement,
she virtually supervises her girl’s education
and molds her views of life, morals and manners.
The father is, at most, Prince Consort, playing
an insignificant part in the selection of associates
and instructors, and no part at all in the regulation
of deportment, speech and dress. “My
mother thinks,” and “My mother says,” are cast-iron
formulas that make an end of all controversy
while the girl is in short skirts and wears her unshorn
locks between her shoulders. With the
lengthened skirts, and trussed hair, comes entrance
upon the school or college world, and the beginning
of individual life.</p>

<h3>The Mother’s Influence</h3>

<p class="author">By “Ouida”</p>

<p class="intro">(Mlle. Louise de la Ramee, Author of “Under Two Flags,”
“A Dog of Flanders,” etc. Died Jan. 28, 1908. The following is
from one of a series of articles written and sold to Lippincott’s 28
years ago with the request that they be not published until after
her death. The articles appeared in the May, June, and July, 1909,
issues.)</p>

</div>

<p>When we reflect on the enormous weight which
the woman’s influence has on the growing child;
when we consider the incurable superstitions, the
unreasonable fables, the illogical deductions, the
warped and stifled judgments, which millions of
young boys learn in education and religion at their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
mothers’ knees in infancy,—it is impossible to over-rate
the invaluable consequences of any introduction
of <i>geist</i> into the minds of women. But for the
backward pressure of woman—woman ever conservative,
ever <i>reculante</i>, ever wedded to form and precedent,
and to tradition—the world of men would
have forsaken many a <i>cultus</i> built on fable, many
a dominion of priestcraft, many a limbo of worn-out
and oppressive credulity. The evil mental influence
of women is fully as great as can be the good
moral influence of the best of their sex. Wars
hounded on; fetters freshly riveted; the withes of
dead beliefs binding down the free action of living
limbs; the pressure of narrow ties, and of egotisms
deified to virtue, forcing men aside from paths of
greatness or justice—all those, and much more, are
due to the baleful intellectual influence of women.</p>

<h3>Fatherhood Cannot Be Motherhood</h3>

<p class="author">By Ada M. Kassimer</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From Introduction to “Representative Women.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Womanhood now as always recognizes motherhood
as its highest duty, its greatest obligation; and
the present awakened womanhood sees its mission
of motherhood—not only in the narrowed home immediately
about it, but in the large human family,
in the world of activity, it sees how the affairs of
men, women and children need the true mother instinct,
which in every phase of nature is one of unselfish
devotion, of unlimited service, of freedom
from combat for financial, social and personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
supremacy. The inherent attributes of motherhood
must combine with those of fatherhood to square the
balance of justice for childhood.</p>

<p>The world needs woman, her ideas, her way of
reasoning, her insight, her sense of justice, her tender
hands and her loving heart. The children of the
world need her; for a long time they have been
governed by the masculine mind which has made
laws for them, established educational plans for
them, opened juvenile courts for them, founded factories,
mills, mines, in which little hands have
hardened, little bodies have dwarfed, young minds
and hearts grown prematurely old—and this, not because
the masculine mind and the masculine heart
would intentionally be drastic, but because men are
not women, and fatherhood cannot be motherhood.</p>

<h3>The Adolescent Child</h3>

<p class="author">By Julia Clark Hallam</p>

<p class="intro">(From “Studies in Child Development.” American contemporary.
Instructor in the University of Chicago.)</p>

</div>

<p>It goes without saying that every mother has
an imperative duty toward her son as he approaches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
this important period in his development. Nature
has done her part in preparing the boy’s body, the
mother must be doing her part in preparing his mind
for all of these new experiences. There are many
things which a mother can do because she is the
mother, and because her mind is mature while the
mind of the boy is yet immature. The mother,
through her study, comes to see that the adolescent
boy is about to acquire new powers. Before, he was
simply an individual. Now he is becoming a part
of the race, because he is acquiring the power of
conserving it. To the mother who has duly prepared
herself for her child’s adolescence, its appearance
will bring the same mysterious thrill which she felt
when she first saw the child as a new-born babe. It
has been said in this connection, “When a baby is
to be born, preparations for its advent are carefully
made. But when, in future years, the most critical
time comes when the child is to be re-born, a man
or a woman, it is rare that intelligent suggestions
or wise words of counsel tell him or her of the importance
of the period.”</p>

<h3>Wise Mothers</h3>

<p>We shall never have really good mothers until
women cease to make motherhood the central idea of
their existence. The woman who has no interest

<p>I spent six months one winter in the various
factories of New York in order to get information
by actual experience. I can truthfully and conservatively
say that not more than one out of two
girls employed in the factory trades for a year or
more are physically fitted to be wives and mothers,
not considering their fitness mentally, morally or
spiritually. There are six million women workers
in the United States. If fifty per cent., not ninety,
are made physically, mentally and morally unfit for
wife and motherhood by doing work unsuited to
their strength, then the wage-system must be weighed
and “found wanting” indeed. Economic conditions
which force women to work in unsuitable industrial
occupations are not only a fruitful cause for divorce,
but an outrage against humanity as well.</p>

<h3>A Good Mother</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary Wollstonecraft<br>
1759-1797</p>

<p class="intro">(English. The mother of Mary, wife of the poet Shelley. One
of the earliest advocates of the right of woman to education, and
political rights.)</p>

</div>

<p>To be a good mother, a woman must have sense,
and that independence of mind which few women
possess who are taught to depend entirely on their
husbands. Meek wives are, in general, foolish
mothers; wanting their children to love them best,
and take their part, in secret against the father, who
is held up as a scarecrow. When chastisement is
necessary, though they have offended the mother, the
father must inflict the punishment; he must be the
judge in all disputes; ... I ... mean to insist that
unless the understanding of woman is enlarged, and
her character rendered firm, but being allowed to
govern her own conduct, she will never have sufficient
sense or command of temper to manage her children
properly.</p>

<h3>The Mother a Creator</h3>

<p class="author">By C. Josephine Barton</p>

<p class="intro">(Contemporary. Formerly associate editor and publisher “The
Life,” author of “An Interlude,” “Evangel Ahvallah,” “The
Mother of the Living,” etc.)</p>

</div>

<p>Thoughts are the blocks out of which children
are made.... Your child’s thoughts will flow in the
trenches you open for it. During the impressible
first few months it will cultivate that which you
cultivate. If you love, it will love; if you hate, it
will hate. If you have the measles, it will have it;
the child will rejoice at your rejoicing, and will weep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
when you weep. (This is one instance wherein if
you “weep you will <i>not</i> weep alone”! Anger indulged
in by you will make the foetus helpless in
Anger’s toils! Love humanity, find and faithfully
perform your work, and your unborn child will one
day be a philanthropist....</p>

<p>Two brothers manifested the same criminality
their father had been guilty of when begetting them,
and they became even worse men, because their weak,
unresisting mother took no control over them during
the months most important, and their passions developed.
Thus the design and form of temple unwittingly
carved out in the brain of their two sons,
developed the phrenological bumps, criminal protuberances
to match the design marked out for them
by their father in his unenlightened Temple of
Thought. This condition could not have been altered
by any process known except that of the mother’s
thought-action during the period of pliability in the
atom. But being incompetent, unable to systematize
her thoughts and purify her heart, or cultivate the
philosophical and rational, the begotten shape developed
with all the qualities about it that had so
blighted the begetter....</p>

<p>It is with pleasure I turn from the above picture
and point out to you the laws leading up to the beautiful
character of Elizabeth Cady Stanton—one of
the bravest of leaders in the cause of woman’s
emancipation. Daniel Cady was a distinguished
lawyer, a New York judge, later elected to Congress.
Though a man of fine qualities, unimpeachable integrity,
he was sensitive and modest to a marked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
degree; while her mother, Margaret Livingston, had
the military idea of government, was tall and queenly,
self-reliant and at her ease under all circumstances.
She was the daughter of Colonel Livingston, who,
at West Point, when Arnold made the attempt to
betray that stronghold into the enemy’s hands, in
the absence of his superior officer, took the responsibility
of firing into the Vulture, a suspicious looking
British vessel that lay at anchor on the opposite side
of the river, leaving Andre, the British spy, with his
papers to be captured.</p>

<p>The foregoing shows the result of the influence
of two united energies in the production of a powerful
woman. To modify the effect of her begetter’s
modesty, the mother’s military ideas stood in good
place; and to supplement his embarrassment, she was
full of courage; so that even if her father had implanted
the foundation for the cultivation of an over-modest
child, the mother made up the happy balance
during her supervision, and it resulted in the freedom
of individuality in the beautiful woman who has
blessed the race with light, in the dispelling of many
clouds. The loving and faithful mother of seven
children, she found time to fill a noble sphere in public,
one in which they could rise up to call her blessed.</p>

<h3>Collective Motherhood</h3>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Author of “What Eight Million
Women Want.” From an article in “Good Housekeeping.”)</p>

</div>

<p>We have the ideal of collective motherhood expressing
itself through the women’s clubs, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
consumer’s leagues, through mothers’ congresses,
through a dozen like agencies. We have the ideal
for a collective fatherhood also, but this is waiting
to express itself through organizations, which can
be formed only by men. Of the details of children’s
lives the average man knows infinitely less than do
women. Of the interrelationship of children and the
whole structure of society most men know nothing at
all.</p>

<h3>The Companion Mother</h3>

<p>A woman never lived who did all she might have
done to open the mind of her child for its great adventure.
It is an exhaustless task. The woman who
sees it knows she has need of all the education the
college can give, all the experience and culture she
can gather. She knows that the fuller her individual
life, the broader her interests, the better for the child.
She should be a better person in their eyes. The real
service of the “higher education,”—the freedom to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
take part in whatever interests or stimulates her—lies
in the fact that it fits her intellectually to be a companion
worthy of a child.</p>

<h3>Parental Respect for Right of Children</h3>

<p>A mother happy in the friendship of her own
daughter, said not long ago that she desired to erect
an asylum for tormented daughters. Such an asylum
would be as necessary as a protection against pampering
parents as against those who are overbearing.
Both alike torture their children though in different
ways, by not understanding the child’s right to have
his own point of view, his own ideal of happiness, his
own proper tastes and occupations. They do not
see that children exist as little for their parents’ sake
as parents do for their children’s sake.... Family
life would have an intelligent character if each one
lived fully and entirely his own life and allowed the
others to do the same. None should tyrannize over,
none should suffer tyranny from, the other. Parents
who give their homes this character can justly demand
that children shall accommodate themselves to
the habits of the household as long as they live in it.
Children on their part can ask that their own life
of thought and feeling shall be left in peace at home,
or that they shall be treated with the same consideration
that would be accorded to a stranger. When the
parents do not meet these conditions they themselves
are the greater sufferers.</p>

<h3>The Ancient and Modern Mother</h3>

“Mexico As I Saw It,” “Sunny Sicily,” etc. From “Women the

</div>

<p>The ancient mother and the modern mother are
two very different beings. The very ancient mother
fought for her child like the tigress for her young
cubs. The mother of past generations gave her entire
life to her children to the absolute neglect of her
husband. The modern mother, although she sometimes
neglects her children for her fads and frivolities
is really a much more sane person, for she lives three
lives; one part she gives to her husband, one part to
her children, and a third part to herself. Instead of
entirely obliterating herself, as the ancient mother
did, she believes in self-culture, self-advancement,
and is a thinking, human being; she is therefore more
of a companion to her husband, and more capable of
educating her offspring.</p>

<h3>The Mother</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Emmaline Pethick-Lawrence</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “Votes for Women.”)</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_180">See page 180</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>In a small room, dimly lighted, sat a woman
making collars. Above the humming of her sewing
machine the clock of a neighboring church struck
ten. The woman lifted her head, and, gathering up
her work, folded it together. She crossed the room
and looked down upon the faces of two boys sleeping.
“Christmas Eve!” she sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>She went back to cover up the machine. Sitting
wearily, she leant her weight upon it and her head
sank upon her arms. Last year it had all been so
different! She had to be both father and mother
now, since the bread-winner had been cut down by
the hand of death falling with an awful suddenness.
And within her body there slept, soon to waken to
life, a child. “Pray God it be a boy,” she moaned.
“If not, pray God it may die! It is too terrible to
be a woman.”</p>

<p>She thought of the girl on the second floor who
had been taken that day to the workhouse infirmary;
she knew her story. The girl had been a waitress in
a tea shop. She earned her food and five shillings
a week. She could not live alone in the world on
that wage. She had accepted the “protection” of a
man more than twice her age. When her trouble
came he had tired of her. He had left her. She did
not know where he was now. Would that child who
was to be born in the workhouse be a girl, too? She
hoped not. She prayed that it might be a boy.</p>

<p>She remembered the old woman who had tried
to drown herself last week. The old woman’s husband
had died; that was a year ago. The widow had
taken in work for an army clothing establishment.
But the money she earned had hardly paid the rent.
The case had made something of a sensation in the
police court. The papers had taken it up for a day
or two. The employer said it was the Government
that was to blame. The Government would not allow
its contracts to be carried out by the sweated labor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of men, but the sweating of women did not matter.
Women did not seem to matter to anybody. When
her husband was alive she had not realized it. She
realized it now. She remembered, though, that even
in these days—</p>

<p>Suddenly her room seemed full of light. Afar
off she heard a burst of song. It came nearer. Never
had she listened to such music. The woman lifted
her head. The window was gone, the whole of the
outside wall had fallen noiselessly away, and the
sky was filled with a glory that was not of the sun
nor of the moon. The light seemed to come from a
cloud, and the singing, too. No, it was not a cloud,
it was a host of radiant forms, for, as she looked,
those shining ones came nearer to her, and she could
hear their voices: “Good tidings of great joy!”</p>

<p>So that was what they were singing! Where had
she heard it before? The words seemed so familiar
to her that, though she wondered, she was not overwhelmed
with surprise. Then came a rapturous outburst:
“They that dwell in the land of the shadow
of death—upon them hath the light shined.” The
light! How wonderful it was! How amazing! It
seemed to the woman like a glorious sea upon which
her spirit floated—a flood which drowned her senses,
so that for a moment or two she lost consciousness of
all else. Then once again her attention was arrested
by the singing, because she heard these words: “For
unto us a child is born.” “Pray God it is a boy,”
she murmured.</p>

<p>She wanted to hear more, and listened breathlessly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
now. Nearer and nearer to her came the voices,
and she heard a new refrain that seemed to fill both
heaven and earth with ringing joy: “To set at
liberty—them that are bruised.”</p>

<p>Suddenly that triumphant chanting became a
lament. “No room! No room!” wailed that multitude
of voices. “The door of the mother’s heart is
shut. She prays that the child may die!” Then the
woman knew that it was the child who stirred within
her, whose coming the angels had heralded. The
woman child! Yes, for she had prayed that it might
die, and her heart stood still with fear.</p>

<p>And it seemed to the woman that the wall had
been built up and the room was dark again, save for
the light of one small lamp. But in her heart she
heard still the echo of the song: “They that dwell
in the land of the shadow of death”—that was the
girl in the workhouse infirmary; that was the old
woman in the police court charged with attempted
suicide; that was herself—upon them “hath the light
shined.” “For unto us a child is born, a Saviour,
which”—Then she understood. It was her own child.
The child that moved under her heart. What was it
came next? Ah! It came back to her now; she
seemed to hear again that burst of joy that filled the
sky with song: “To set at liberty them that are
bruised.”</p>

<p>Who were the bruised? Some one had told her
a story a few hours ago. It was about the poor creature
at the corner of the street; her husband had come
back last Saturday and demanded money; had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
knocked her down and kicked her; the magistrate
had made a joke about it in court, and everybody
had laughed except the woman. She had wept bitterly.
But nobody seemed to care. “To set at liberty
them that are bruised.” The poor thing was
horribly bruised, they said. But was she not “at
liberty?” No, she was in bondage—cruel bondage.
Were all women in bondage? If so, some of the fetters
were made of gold. Were fetters of gold light?
Some one was going to break the fetters. And that
some one was—her own child. “No! No!” she
cried, in agony. “It is she—my child—who will
be broken! Rather let her die now, before she has
become acquainted with grief.”</p>

<p>Then the woman felt herself folded in a purple
mantle, so that she could not see, but she was not
afraid, rather comforted, as if with a sense of deep
security. “I am destiny,” she heard; “your child
will be safe with me. I will cover her with my arm. I
will hide her in the secret place of the Most High.
She shall break in pieces the fetters of those who are
in bondage.”</p>

<p>“Then she shall not herself be broken?” faltered
the mother.</p>

<p>“She shall be broken,” answered Destiny, “yet
not her spirit. That shall return victorious to God,
who sends it forth.”</p>

<p>“Tell me one thing,” pleaded the mother, “Shall
the joy of my child outweigh her sorrow?”</p>

<p>“The angels sang at the birth of One who was
destined to be crucified for the world. Did the joy
of the crucified outweigh the sorrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“I do not know,” she answered.</p>

<p>“According to her strength her joy shall be like
unto His joy, and her sorrow like unto His sorrow.”</p>

<p>And the mother said, “God’s will be done.”</p>

<p>And when the veil was removed it seemed as
though the little room was full of those shining
presences who had drawn near to her from the singing
hosts of heaven.</p>

<p>“I am Wisdom,” said one, and laid a hand upon
the woman’s head. “I give to your child what is
mine.” “I am Vision,” cried another, kissing her
eyes, saying, “For the child’s sake.” And Love was
revealed, as Love reverently touched the child where
she lay beneath the mother’s heart, saying: “It is
I who give to women the courage that amazes strong
men.” “Take from me for the child that shall be
born, my double-edged sword, the spirit and the
word,” said one: “My name is Inspiration.”</p>

<p>Then once more there was wafted upon the air
the singing of the heavenly host—and the outside wall
had disappeared again, and the garret was open to
the sky. And the heart of the woman sang with the
joy of the angels: “For unto us a child is born.” ...</p>

<p>A peal of bells rang out from the church. One
of the boys stirred, sat up, and cried out, “Mother!”
She lifted her head. “Hush!” she said, “Hush,
the angels are singing.” She rose and walked to the
window, drawing aside the curtain. A star shone
brilliantly; it seemed to shoot a shaft of light into
the room. The Christmas chimes clamored their tidings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
She went back and knelt by the startled child.
“Kiss mother,” she said, as she put her arms about
him. “It is Christmas morning.”</p>

<h3>I Am the Mother-Heart</h3>

</div>

<p>I am the Mother-heart of this nation.</p>

<p>I have loved and nourished its little ones in age-long
mother fashion; have swelled with pride when
the nation has protected them from disease; come
nearly to bursting with unuttered gratitude when
happiness has come to the youth of the land.</p>

<p>I have spent many long, sleepless nights weeping
over the fate of millions of my babies, forced
from home, school and mother, to the factories and
shops of the cities, and all night have wondered
“why” and “how long?”</p>

<p>I am haunted by the childish protestations, desirous
glances from faded, childish eyes, and bleed
anew when I see my children marching from the
factory door, their bent and bony figures clad in
rags.</p>

<p>I, the Mother-heart of the nation have been deceived,
tricked and defrauded.</p>

<p>I believed that modern industry, with all the
improvements, could provide for my infants; believed
the mighty labor-saving machines would not
require the help of my babies to feed the world; believed
the children would be given plenty of time in
which to grow healthy bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>I have, however, awakened to existing conditions.
No longer will I be submissive.</p>

<p>I have ever been a power for good, but seldom
rebellious.</p>

<p>I am now pulsing red blood. I will temper my
mother-love with human justice and stand only for
right.</p>

<p>I will help restore to my babies the privileges of
their years.</p>

<p>I can labor for justice and hover my young flock.</p>

<p>I no longer send out purely love throbs, but send
warnings to those who have been blinded by gold.</p>

<p>I beat in harmony with the masses struggling for
freedom, feeling confident of results. I beat with will
and determination, a glorious future before me.</p>

<p>I know the day will come when the Mother-heart
of all nations will be content because of the reign of
justice.</p>

<p>I realize my responsibility and beat the faster.</p>

<p>I am the Mother-heart of this nation.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Love</h3>

</div>

<p>Only one in the whole world recognizes my claim
to the personality, and does not wish merely to use
and swallow up some part or other of me; loves me
as nature created me, and fate distorted me; understands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
this fate; is willing to leave me the remainder
of my life, and to gladden it and draw it nearer to
heaven; and, for the happiness of being my friend,
will be, do, and leave all for me. This is the man
who is called my bridegroom.</p>

<h3>A Man Never Gets Over It</h3>

<p>“I mean to have a swell home, if I am a
bachelor,” boasted Timmy. “I feel like I wanted it.
It’s just another game, I guess. But I’ll play a lone
hand—I don’t reckon a man can be ready for matrimony
when it sends cold shivers down his spine just
to think of it, do you?”</p>

<p>Kid lowered his voice.</p>

<p>“Timmy, listen a minute. I’ll tell you something—<i>a
man never gets over feelin’ that way about
it</i>. He just has to kind of chloroform them feelings
and hurry along with it. Because there ain’t no
doubt it’s the thing to do.”</p>

<h3>Marriage, a Partnership</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Newell Dwight Hillis</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. From “The American Woman and
Her Home.”)</p>

</div>

<p>There is a sense in which marriage is a contract,
at the same time business, moral and social....</p>

<p>Marriage is looked upon often as the consummation
of the romance of life, whereas, it is simply its
beginning. It is called a matter of the heart, which
it should be, but it should also be an affair of the
intellect. It is fortunate that the day of early marriage
has passed, since the early marriage implied a
choice guided almost wholly by the emotions, as the
intellect is slower in its development than the heart.
But marriage should involve both heart and brain
and fulfill the chief desire of both.</p>

<p>If marriage laws are wrong, mend them. If marriage
customs offend, change them. If other people’s

<h3>A New Stimulus to Marriage</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. St. Clair Stobart</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_55">See page 55</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>As concerns marriage, if it should indeed be true
that women, who can find practical work in life outside
marriage, would no longer be so eager to marry,
this would not necessarily be an evil, for it would
probably act as an additional incentive to man to
desire marriage. Marriage has been regarded for
women as a profession in which failure involves, as
in other professions, humiliation. Women are
trained, therefore, under the present régime, to employ
all the arts at their disposal to ensure success in
their profession.... If women were absorbed in
professions and occupations, such as farming, architecture,
territorial service, and the like, and only desired
marriage when and because they loved, we
would have the loss in the woman of the wiles and
artificialities which formerly stimulated the man, and
marriage would be counterbalanced by a more healthy
emulation on the part of the man, who would be desirous
to obtain something of value which was difficult
to get.</p>

<h3>Postponing Marriage</h3>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_172">See page 172</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>A very important question in this connection is
whether, in promising fidelity to one woman, a lover
is really undertaking more than he can perform.
When he postpones marriage to the latest possible
moment man is certainly not offering to his bride
that gift of a life-long devotion which is part of the
ideal of true love.</p>

<h3>Marriage of the “Friends”</h3>

<p class="author">By Lucretia Mott</p>

<p class="intro">(One of the early leaders in the Woman Suffrage, Anti-Slavery,
and other progressive movements of her time. A member of the
Society of Friends—a Quaker. The following is from a letter
written in 1869 to Josephine Butler, of England.)</p>

</div>

<p>In the Marriage union, no ministerial or other
official aid is required to consecrate or legalize the
bond. After due care in making known their intentions,
the parties, in presence of their friends, announce
their covenant, with pledge of fidelity and
affection, invoking Divine aid for its faithful fulfilment.
There is no assumed authority or admitted
inferiority, no <i>promise</i> of obedience. Their independence
is equal, their dependence mutual, and their
obligations reciprocal. This of course has had its influence
on married life and the welfare of families.
The permanence and happiness of the conjugal relation
among us have ever borne a favorable comparison
with those of other denominations.</p>

<h3>The Love That Pales</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary Wollstonecraft<br>
1759-1797</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_121">See page 121</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Youth is the season for love in both sexes; but
in those days of thoughtless enjoyment provision
should be made for the more important years of life,
when reflection takes place of sensation. But Rousseau,
and most of the male writers who have followed
his steps, have warmly inculcated that the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
tendency of female education ought to be directed to
one point—to render them pleasing.</p>

<p>Let me reason with the supporters of this opinion
who have any knowledge of human nature. Do
they imagine that marriage can eradicate the habitude
of life? The woman who has only been taught to
please will soon find that her charms are oblique sunbeams,
and that they cannot have much effect on her
husband’s heart when they are seen every day, when
the summer is past and gone. Will she then have
sufficient native energy to look into herself for comfort,
and cultivate her dormant faculties? Or is it
not more rational to expect that she will try to please
other men, and, in the emotions raised by the expectations
of new conquests, endeavor to forget the mortification
her love or pride has received? When the husband
ceases to be a lover, and the time will inevitably
come, her desire of pleasing will then grow languid,
or become a spring of bitterness; and love, perhaps
the most evanescent of all passions, gives place to
jealousy or vanity.</p>

<h3>When Marriage Meant Bondage</h3>

<p>The common law, which regulates the relation of
husband and wife, and is modified only in a few instances
by the statutes, gives the “custody” of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
wife’s person to the husband, so that he has a right
to her even against herself. It gives him her earnings,
no matter with what weariness they have been acquired,
or how greatly she may need them for herself
or her children. It gives him a right to her personal
property which he may will away from her, also the
use of her real estate, and in some of the states, married
women, insane persons and idiots are ranked together
as not fit to make a will; so that she is left with
only one right, which she enjoys in common with the
pauper, the right of maintenance. Indeed, when she
has taken the sacred marriage vows, her legal existence
ceases.</p>

<h3>A Possible Utopia</h3>

<p class="author">By Josephine Pitcairn Knowles</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The Upholstered Cage.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing is permanent, there is going on always a
continual shuffling of the cards of public opinion;
trends of thought, standards of conduct come and go;
and so when the day comes that women are more
economically independent, then they will go on strike
and sweep away all the unworthy suitors and declare
that they will only mate with the physically and
mentally sound, and then all considerations but love
and respect will go by the board. This will appear
but a distant and unrealizable Utopia to many who
read this; nevertheless it will happen; all changes
seem incredible from the distance, but when they
crystallize themselves in fact nothing appears more
natural or suitable. Every prophecy since the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
of history has been scouted in its first inception,
but when in time it has fulfilled itself it is
seen to be the very thing awaited, natural and obvious,
and a direct result of the past sequence of
events.</p>

<h3>Marriage and the Labor Market</h3>

<p class="author">By M. Carey Thomas</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_10">See page 10</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Recent investigations of the after lives of college
women and of their sisters who have not been to
college have shown us that only about one-half of
the daughters of men of the professional business
classes who do not inherit independent fortunes can
look forward to marriage. Statistics seem to prove
that only fifty per cent. of the women of these classes
marry. What are the other fifty per cent. to do except
work or starve? Most women of independent
means marry because their inherited fortunes enable
them to contribute to the support of the family.
Women of the working classes marry because they
too, can help by their labor to support the family. It
is only the dowerless women who are prevented by social
usage from engaging in paid work outside the
home, or in manual labor inside the home, after marriage,
who remain unmarried. All other women are
married and at work.</p>

<p>Is it well for the great middle classes of our civilized
nations that is, for the classes that are not very
poor or very rich, to contain these ever increasing
number of celibate men and women? To such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
question there can be only one reply. If it is ill, as
we all admit, why do we not encourage the women of
these middle classes to work and marry like the
women of the poorer classes who are practically all
married? Why in England and Germany and the
United States are there these thousands upon thousands
of unmarried women teachers, a celibate class
like the monks and nuns of the Middle Ages, and
like them an ever present menace to the welfare of the
state? Why in Italy, on the other hand, are so many
of the women public school teachers married? Because
in Germany and England and the United States
women teachers lose their positions when they marry,
and marry and starve they cannot. Because in Italy
women teachers are allowed to marry and teach. Is it
inconceivable that the state of the future in which
women as well as men will vote will deprive women of
bread because they wish to marry?</p>

<h3>Marriage Laws in 1850</h3>

<p class="author">By Clarina Howard Nichols</p>

<p class="intro">(From speech at Woman’s Suffrage Convention in 1852.
Quoted from “Life of Susan B. Anthony.”)</p>

</div>

<p>If a wife is compelled to get a divorce on account
of the infidelity of the husband, she forfeits all right
to the property which they have earned together,
while the husband, who is the offender still remains
the sole possession and control of the estate. She, the
innocent party, goes out childless and portionless by
decree of law, and he, the criminal, retains the home
and children by favor of the same law. A drunkard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
takes his wife’s clothing to pay his rum bills, and the
court declares that the action is legal because the
wife belongs to the husband.</p>

most heavily on our most chivalrous. It wears them
out physically and mentally and discourages them
spiritually before they are fifty years of age. It gives
them only time enough to nourish a vague doubt of
the womanhood that is content to fatten their toil,
instead of laboring staunchly with them as healthy
women should do. They find their usefulness limited,
their powers exhausted, and wonder why. And then,
sometimes in utter weariness they throw off the yoke
and try to begin again. But the women are not always
wholly to blame for this condition. Sometimes
with a perfectly unreasoning “I can support a wife”
pride, a man will insist that a woman give up once
and forever the only work in which she takes an interest,
and leaves her a choice between idleness and
housework in his home (which always, with or without
fitness, a man will permit a woman to do)! But
if a woman should say to her husband before, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
soon after marriage, “John, it does not please me that
you should be a lawyer—you must become a stock
broker,” or “James, when you marry me you must
give up the art you love and become a carpenter,”
would we not be quick to decry her injustice? Yet
there are men who still say to their wives, “The work
you love you must give up. You may do the work I
provide or none at all.”</p>

<p>Of course, motherhood brings to women certain
limitations, but the thing we do not recognize is that
these limitations are temporary. And, if, in the ages
past, women were able to combine with motherhood
the most arduous physical labors, it seems probable,
that, in the present and future when the demands of
maternity are less rigorous, women should be able,
with gain to the race, to enter new fields of labor and
accomplish laudable results.</p>

<p>Surely there is no greater safeguard for man and
woman than the work in which mind and body can delight.</p>

<h3>Overheard in the Marriage Congress</h3>

<p class="author">By Adella M. Parker</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From the Suffrage Edition of the “Daily News,” Tacoma,
Wash.)</p>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time all the men in the world gathered
together to make the laws of marriage. And the
women, learning of this, gathered also, protesting and
saying:</p>

<p>“A woman is one of the parties to every contract
of marriage. Why do we also not make the laws of
marriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“Woman’s place is at home,” said the men.</p>

<p>“But,” said the women, “the marriage agreement
is the very basis of the home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the men, “but woman’s place is at
home. It is not her place to create the conditions that
make the home.”</p>

<p>“For how long is the marriage contract?” asked
the women.</p>

<p>“Forever,” said the men. Then the women said:</p>

<p>“Suppose we should insist upon helping to make
the contracts we enter into?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be lawful,” said the men.</p>

<p>“Who makes the laws?” said the women.</p>

<p>“We do,” said the men.</p>

<p>“And do the men make the laws concerning the
rights of children?” asked a woman with a babe in
her arms, and another at her heels.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said the men.</p>

<p>“And the laws concerning a woman’s rights with
respect to her own child?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the men, “the women bear the
children, but the men determine their legal control.”</p>

<p>“Can the marriage contract ever be broken?”
asked the bravest one of the women.</p>

<p>“No,” said the men, “it can’t be broken except
upon facts that can’t be proved.”</p>

<p>“Do the men keep the marriage vows?” softly
asked a woman ’way at the rear.</p>

<p>“Hush,” said a portly landlord who owned a
“restricted district;” “no respectable woman would
ask such a question.” Then a thoughtful woman
earnestly asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>“Will there not be more murders, and more suicides
and more insanity if the women have not part
in settling the terms of marriage?”</p>

<p>But the Lombrosos and the Allen McLane Hamiltons
and all the other criminologists and insanity experts
paid no heed to this question. Finally the women
said:</p>

<p>“But suppose we don’t enter into these contracts
that you make?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will,” said the men.</p>

<p>And they did. But some of the women got even.</p>

<h3>The Cry of Man to Woman</h3>

<p class="author">By C. Gasquoine Hartley</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The Truth About Woman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>The cry of man to woman under the patriarchal
system has been, and still for the most part is, “Your
value in our eyes is your sexuality; for your work we
care not.” But mark this! The penalty of this false
adjustment has fallen upon men. For women, in
their turn, have come to value men first in their capacity
as providers for them, caring as little for man’s
sex value as men for women’s work-value. From
the moment when women had to place the economic
considerations in love first, her faculties of discrimination
were no more of service for the selection of the
fittest man. Here we may find the explanation of the
kind of men girls have been willing to marry—old
men, the unfit fathers, the diseased.... And it is the
race that has suffered.</p>

<h3>Marriage the Sole Means of Maintenance</h3>

<p class="author">By Josephine Butler</p>

<p class="intro">(English. Editor of “Woman’s Work and Woman’s Culture,”
published in 1869. From the Introduction.)</p>

</div>

<p>What dignity can there be in the attitude of
women in general, and toward men, in particular,
when marriage is held (and often necessarily so, being
the sole means of maintenance) to be the one end
of a woman’s life, when it is degraded to the level of
a feminine profession, when those who are soliciting
a place in this profession resemble those flaccid Brazilian
creepers which cannot exist without support,
and which sprawl out their limp tendrils in every direction
to find something—no matter what—to hang
upon; when the insipidity or the material necessities
of so many women’s lives make them ready to accept
almost any man who may offer himself? There has
been a pretense of admiring this pretty helplessness of
women. But let me explain that I am not deprecating
the condition of dependence in which God has placed
every human being, man or woman,—the sweet interchange
of services, the give and take of true affection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
the mutual support and aid of friends or lovers, who
have each something to give and to receive. That is
a wholly different thing from the abject dependence
of one entire class of persons on another and a
stronger class. In the present case such a dependence
is liable to peculiar dangers by its complication with
sexual emotions and motives, and with relations which
ought, in an advanced and Christian community, to
rest upon a free and deliberate choice,—a decision
of the judgment and of the heart, and into which the
admission of a necessity, moral or material, introduces
a degrading element.... Cordelia ... declared, “Love
is not love when it is mingled with respects that
stand aloof from the entire point.” Truly, the present
condition of society ... leaves little room for the
heart’s choice.</p>

<h3>Marriage Not an Assurance of Support</h3>

<p class="author">By Alice Henry</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The Trade Union Woman.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>It often happens that marriage in course of time
proves to be anything but an assurance of support.
Early widowed, the young mother herself may have
to earn her children’s bread. Or the husband may become
crippled, or an invalid, or he may turn out a
drunkard or spendthrift. In any of these circumstances,
the responsibility and burden of supporting
the family usually falls upon the wife. Is it strange
that the group so often drifts into undeserved pauperism,
sickness and misery, perhaps later on even into
those depths of social maladjustment that bring about
crime?</p>

<p>“No sooner do we begin upon it than we enter
upon certainties of effecting the happiness of the one

free, that we can neither go out of it nor into it on the
mere invitation, nor abate by saying so one of the
widening circles of its disaster. Whether for better

<h3>Woman in the Home</h3>

<p class="author">By Carrie W. Allen</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The Progressive Woman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>It is generally conceded that woman lives in a
state of subordination to man, and nowhere is this
more apparent than in that sphere which is said to
be distinctly her own, the home.</p>

<p>The woman in the home renders service which
the male wage-earner could not buy. She is the family<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
economist. She mends and makes the garments,
buys the food and clothing, and by her intelligence
and thrift maintains the head of the house in a state
of physical efficiency which enables him to go out
and sell his labor power. The service she renders is
priceless. But, because she brings in no actual
money, she is considered an economic dependent, and
treated as a subordinate because of this dependence.</p>

<p>The lot of this woman is desolately pitiable,
much worse in many cases than that of the woman
who has gone out into industry.</p>

<h3>Morality and Woman in Industry</h3>

<p class="author">By Clara E. Laughlin</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_68">See page 68</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>There seemed to be a widely prevailing idea that
modern industrial conditions, which take women and
girls out of the home are responsible for a great increase
in criminality and immorality. The Government
investigation shows that exactly the reverse is
true. The traditional pursuits of women—housework,
sewing, laundry work, nursing, and the keeping of
boarders furnish more than four-fifths of all the
feminine criminals, compared with only about one-tenth
furnished by all the newer pursuits, including
mills, factories, shops, offices, and the professions; and
the number of criminals who have never been wage-earners
in any pursuit, but who come directly from
their own homes into the courts and penal institutions,
is more than twice as large as that coming from all the
newer industrial pursuits together.</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Millionaire philanthropist. From

</div>

<p>There is an immense amount of feminine talent and energy
wasted in the world every day. This is not due
to the indifference or the laziness of woman, for she
is eager to do, to accomplish, to go out into the field
of life and achieve for herself and her kind. But she
simply does not know how. One of the most important
movements of the day, therefore, is the reawakening
of woman, the building her up on a new basis
of self-help and work for others. That movement will
set loose an amount of talent that will revolutionize
our social life.</p>

</div>

<p>Women have failed to see that the work of every
woman touched that of every other woman. The woman
who works with the hand helps her who works with

</div>

<p>Women are going to work, and they are not going
to limit their work to house service. Let us cease<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
to attempt to make marriage and childbearing a check
upon their work, thereby strengthening their tendencies
toward celibacy and race suicide.... Let us rather
adjust work and marriage and childbearing to a
minimum of incompatibility by lifting inherited taboos
on education in sex facts.</p>

<h3>Development Through Choice of Work</h3>

<p>More and more must we demand that woman be
freed from unmeaning drudgery—and from the enervating
influences of support in return for sex, in
marriage or out of it. Only by self-assertion and by
self-development through the work which she may
elect, will woman come into her own.</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_157">See page 157</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>The demand of the women of the humbler classes
for bread may be more pressing, but it is not more sincere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
than that of the women of the leisure classes for
work. And these two demands coming together, it
seems to me, point to an end so plainly to be discerned,
that I marvel that any should remain blind
to it. The latter demand is the attestation of the
collective human conscience that God does not permit
any to live as cumberers of the earth, and that the
very conditions of their moral existence is, that efforts
and pains taken by them should answer to some part
of the needs of the community.</p>

</div>

<p>It is practically certain that every discussion on
the vocation of woman, whether among feminists or
their opponents, will ultimately lead to the following
problem: woman was obviously intended by nature to
become a mother; modern social requirements make it
obligatory that she should be legally married before
doing so; there are not enough husbands to go round.
What do you propose to do with the women who are
left over?</p>

<h3>Sex-Parasitism</h3>

<p class="author">By Olive Schreiner</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “Woman and Labor.”)</p>

</div>

<p>The position of the unemployed modern female
is one wholly different. The choice before her, as her
ancient fields of domestic labor slip from her, is not
generally or often at the present day the choice between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
finding new fields of labor, or death; but one
far more serious in its ultimate reaction on humanity
as a whole—it is the choice between finding new
forms of labor or sinking slowly into a condition of
more or less complete and passive <i>sex parasitism</i>!</p>

<p>Again and again in the history of the past, when
among human creatures a certain stage of material
civilization has been reached, a curious tendency has
manifested itself for the human female to become
more or less parasitic; social conditions tend to rob
her of all forms of active conscious social labor, and
to reduce her, like the field-bug, to the passive exercise
of her sex functions alone. And the result of this
parasitism has invariably been the decay in vitality
and intelligence of the female, followed by a longer
or shorter period by that of her male descendants and
her entire society.</p>

<h3>The Changed Conditions of Tomorrow</h3>

<p class="author">By Margaret O. B. Wilkinson</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “Parents and Their Problems.”)</p>

</div>

<p>We must accustom ourselves to another new idea
that as marriage is no longer a duty, for all
women, so it is no longer a trade or profession,
requiring all the time and labor of all married women.
Some confusion has arisen on this point because certain
labors have been associated with marriage in the
popular mind. But these labors may, in the near future,
come to be considered as trades in themselves,
not inseparably connected with marriage, and the
wives of the days to come may be found performing
diverse tasks. For we know that in our own times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
women may be the best of wives and good mothers,
but with small knowledge of spinning, weaving, basket-making,
pottery-making, agriculture or even baking,
although all of these trades used to be inseparably
connected with the lives of married women. And tomorrow,
owing to changed conditions, the woman doctor
or lawyer may seem to be as desirable of a mate as
the cook or seamstress today. So much is possible!</p>

<h3>Woman’s Work in Woman’s Way</h3>

<p class="author">By Lida Parce</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Educator. Author of “Economic
Determinism,” etc. From “The Progressive Woman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>If the economic interest is the important one,
then woman’s work has always been the important
work. The loom and the hand mill were strictly feminine
implements, so long as their product was used
only to supply the wants of the people. Only when
the products of the loom and the mill became useful
in competition did man take them up; and then for
purposes of exploitation. For thousands of years
man has devastated the earth and drenched it in blood
to further that exploitation. Now he is beginning to
find out that, after all, the only safe and proper use
that can be made of goods is in supplying the needs of
the people. Man has not yet begun to learn humility,
but he will learn it.</p>

<p>Isn’t it time for women to begin to defend their
work, and their way of doing it? And to make a
sober and critical estimate of the part that man has
played in history? I think that women may well take
pride in doing their work in a woman’s way.</p>

<h3>Women Workers in New England</h3>

<p class="author">By Annie Marion MacLean, Ph. D.</p>

<p class="intro">(Professor of Sociology in Adelphi College. From “Wage-Earning
Women.”)</p>

</div>

<p>It was in New England that women and girls
first went out in large numbers to work with their
husbands and fathers and brothers in the mill. They
followed the industries from the fireside to the factory.
It was a natural movement stimulated in many
cases by necessity. At that time public opinion
frowned on the idle girl, and work was considered a
crowning virtue; so the factory girl was not commiserated
but commended. Things have changed in the
last century, and now we find most people of humanitarian
instincts looking with regret at the spectacle
of young girls marching to the mills. The procession
is a long one in the old New England towns, and it is
growing longer with the years....</p>

<p>When Charles Dickens came to America, it was
to Lowell he went to see the cotton-mills in operation,
and it was of those mills he wrote his glowing picture
of factory life for women. “They look like human
beings,” he said, “not like beasts of burden.” If he
were to come to us to-day to see the cotton workers,
he would, in all probability, be taken to Fall River
first and asked to behold the product of the evolution
of two generations. He would see no beautiful window
boxes, no smiling girls making poetry as they
worked, or moving about with songs on their lips.
Life is grim in the Fall River mills, and the women
come perilously near having the mien of “beasts of
burden.” The semi-idyllic conditions of the early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
New England cotton-mill have given way to a system
brutalized by greed and the exigencies of modern industry.</p>

<h3>One-Fifth of the Women Population at Work</h3>

<p class="author">By M. Carey Thomas</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_10">See page 10</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Unheralded, with no blare of trumpets, reluctantly
emerging into the light, are millions of women
wage-earners thronging every trade and profession,
multiplying themselves beyond all calculation from
census to census in every country of the civilized
world. Even in the United States where fewer women
are at work than in any other country about five millions
of women, or about one-fifth of all women of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
working age, are supporting themselves outside the
home. It is because this industrial revolution has
taken place in our own lifetime that we do not as yet
realize it. Women of my own age, however, need
only refer to their own experience. I can remember
when no women at all were employed in business
offices, when the business streets of New York and
Philadelphia and Baltimore were practically deserted
by women. Now all the great office buildings are like
rabbit hutches swarming with women typewriters,
women bookkeepers, women secretaries, and business
women of every sort, kind and description. Already
everyone who studies the subject is compelled to recognize
that whether we wish it or not the economic independence
of women is taking place before our eyes.
Men of the poorer classes have long been unable to
care for their families without the assistance of women,
and men of the classes which formerly supported
their wives and daughters in comfort are now unable
to do so and are becoming increasingly unwilling to
marry and assume responsibility which they cannot
meet....</p>

<p>Upon how the woman worker of today is housed,
depends, very largely, the efficiency and productiveness
of her work. But, more impelling still, upon how
she is housed depends the efficiency and productiveness

that we have many married and widowed industrial

<h3>The Old and New Schools</h3>

<p class="author">By Florence Elberta Barns</p>

<p class="intro">(From “Social Aspects of Industrial Education” in “Education”—a
monthly school magazine.)</p>

</div>

<p>The master of the old school looked askance at
the master of the new school, and the following conversation
is recorded:</p>

<p>“Young man, in my day, in your day, in the
present day, and in the future day, the three R’s
were, are, and will be, the necessary and most efficient
training for our school children. Can you deny the
evidence of generations trained in this way?”</p>

<p>“Nay, my master, I do not dispute that the three
R’s are a necessity to the mental development of the
race, but my contention is that besides this literary
culture, and theoretical knowledge, a training for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
hands, and practical ability should be fostered, and
included within the curriculum of our schools. Can
you deny the evidence of the present day, testifying
to the need of efficient training in all branches of
industry and business, as well as in the professions
and arts? How, dear sir, are we to meet this pressing
need, and prepare our people for a life of useful labor,
if we do not begin to train them from the primary
class?”</p>

<p>“And so, sir, you would join the ranks of those
who are commercializing all the fine arts, who are forgetting
all else but money in capital letters?”</p>

<p>“You do not understand, my master. Under the
great economic pressure of the times, waste-labor must
be avoided, and training is the only means of
avoidance. Think of the mass of immigrants that
flock to our cities, to be amalgamated with our race.
It is a laboring class, and self-preservation demands
that we provide suitable living and working centers
for it and its posterity. And our own people demand
the same consideration in view of the fact that the
great majority, poor, middle-class, and rich, are employed
in some art, industrial or fine. All fine arts,
they, if we provide efficient training for skill and
fine workmanship.”</p>

<p>“I am grieved that one of my former pupils
should so forget the ideals of education. If you must,
build schools for those who wish industrial training,
but keep our cultural schools undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that would not be democratic, my master,
and neither would it be effective. Our idea is to
develop both the brain and the hand—in this way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
opening the door to the life work which appeals most
to each individual.”</p>

<p>And the master of the old school answered,
“Well.”</p>

<p>In the above we find the prevailing controversy
between the old and the new, a controversy which
must cease with the progression of thought, and
understanding of the times.</p>

<h3>Essentials in Education</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary Snow</p>

<p class="intro">(Supervisor, Household Arts and Science, Board of Education,
Chicago. From “The Child in the City.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Certainly some essential is missing. Children are
not dull about significant truths. They wish to know
how to read and to write and to manipulate number
processes. They have wholesome and often keen interest
in the movements and experiences of people
and the great figures in history; they work hard and
cheerfully to know somewhat of the countries of the
earth. Musical expression satisfies and delights them.
Art entices them up to the point where they find that
it misses practical application, and then interest dies
and with it expression. Then they begin to reach
after further reality with passionate earnestness.
They long to express themselves in tangible ways.
They have a right consciously to experience the sensations
of knowing that they know and knowing that
they can do. If opportunity for “doing” has been
opened to them, they will have gained in strength of
character through their authoritative wills commanding
their powers, and the purposive and co-ordinate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
work of the motor phases of education will have furnished
a kind of test of progress, a mental verification
of accomplishment that can never come through
any academic work. They have many measuring rods
in the evaluation of the finished task—the eye, the
muscular tension, judgment, comparison, trial. There
is necessary integrity since no amount of vanity will
make the tangible result reveal anything but truth.
William James, with ever brilliant insight, said that
manual training did more for the moral strength of
youth than any other subject in the curriculum.</p>

<p>No one before him so ably demonstrated the civic

Froebel, in discovering—not devising—the ways and

every temptation to which flesh is heir, and becoming
a voluntary, law-abiding citizen of both the individual

<h3>Mothers’ Library</h3>

<p class="intro">(First chairman of literature in the National Congress of

</div>

<p>It seems a rather hard condition that though the
years when a mother feels most deeply her need for
more knowledge of children she should usually have
least time for reading and study. This would not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
so disastrous if school and college curricula were not
framed to embrace even the slightest preparation for
home life. That profession which demands a knowledge
of sanitation, dietetics, and chemistry of cooking,
careful and economic purchasing, artistic and
hygienic furnishing, to say nothing of the care of
children, is surely of sufficient dignity to deserve some
preparation.... We can learn no science or art entirely
from books, but when good trails have been
blazed by those who have gone before us, it is foolish
to attempt our own untried paths. Every mother can
hang a little book-shelf in her busiest corner, and put
on it from time to time a few books, which will be to
her what his Blackstone is to a lawyer, his Baedeker
to a traveler.</p>

<h3>The Aim and End of Education</h3>

<p class="author">By Lola Ridge</p>

<p class="intro">(Former organiser of the Modern School in New York. In
“Everyman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>What do we imagine to be the end and aim of
education? Most people will say, the acquisition of
knowledge. Knowledge of what? Of oneself, of
humanity, of life? If this was the ideal, as conceived
by the builders of the present system, it has not been
attained; or perhaps the system, like a Frankenstein
creation, has grown beyond all intent of its sponsors,
exhibiting a diabolic and independent will....</p>

<p>Let us examine the effect of public school education
upon the psychology of the child; then we shall
see if we are “wasting our energies.”</p>

<p>In the first place, no gardener would think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
giving each plant the same amount of air and sun,
and the same quality of soil. Yet this is exactly what
you are doing to your children, and there are as many
different kinds of children as there are different kinds
of flowers. Why pay more attention to the cultivation
of a vegetable than to the development of a
human being? Each child requires individual attention,
individual understanding, and individual mental
food.</p>

<h3>Standards Raised by Women Teachers</h3>

<p class="author">By Anne Bigoney Stewart</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The Educational Review.”)</p>

</div>

<p>It is due to the perseverance of the women in
their poorly paid duty that teaching is gradually
emerging into a regular profession with a proper
stipend and respectable standing, and now when such
is the result, we have men crowding back into the profession
grumblingly, complaining of the poor pay,
and throwing up their hands in “holy horror” at the
“woman peril.”</p>

<p>And after all, of what does “the woman peril”
consist? That boys are being feminized; that is, that
boys are being trained to decenter standards of living?
That they do not so much drink, or smoke, or,
we hope, “sow wild oats,” that they do not so much
regard these acts as manly, or a necessary part of
their upbringing? That war is not a regular occupation;
that peace is desirable and to be sought after?</p>

<p>“That abnormal families in which the mother’s
influence is too long continued and not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
counteracted by masculine control are notoriously productive
of decadence and degeneracy.”</p>

<p>That is certainly a grave charge! “A mother’s
influence”! that which has been the theme of poets,
artists, scholars, essayists, the clergy, for centuries,
“productive of decadence and degeneracy.”</p>

<p>It would appear that logically as the masculine
mind may think, its logic is not unassailable.</p>

<h3>Educating Children</h3>

<p class="author">By Maria Montessori</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From speech delivered in California.)</p>

</div>

<p>What shall we say, then, when the question before
us is that of educating children?</p>

<p>We know only too well the sorry spectacle of the
teacher, who, in the ordinary school room, must pour
certain cut and dried facts into the heads of the
scholars. In order to succeed in this barren path she
finds it necessary to discipline her pupils into immobility
and to force their attention. Prizes and punishments
are ever ready and efficient aids to the master
who must force into a given attitude of mind and
body those who are condemned to be his listeners.</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_266">See page 266</a>)</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The Business of Being a Woman.”)</p>

</div>

<p>A woman never lived who did all she might have
done to open the mind of her child for its great adventure.
It is an exhaustless task. The woman who
sees it knows she has need of all the education the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
college can give, all the experience and culture she can
gather. She knows that the fuller her individual life,
the broader her interests, the better for the child.
She should be a person in their eyes. The real service
of the “higher education,” the freedom to take part
in whatever interests or stimulates her—lies in the
fact that it fits her intellectually to be a companion
worthy of a child.</p>

<h3>A Plan for Improving Female Education</h3>

<p class="author">By Mrs. Emma Willard</p>

<p class="intro">(From a paper read by Mrs. Willard before the members of
the New York Legislature, in behalf of a girl’s seminary, in 1819.
Reproduced in “Woman and the Higher Education,” Distaff Series.)</p>

</div>

<p>The object of this address is to convince the
public that a reform with respect to female education
is necessary; that it cannot be effected by individual
exertion, but that it requires the aid of the Legislature;
and, further, by showing the justice, the policy
and the magnanimity of such an undertaking, to persuade
that body to endow a seminary for females as
the commencement of such reformation.</p>

<p>The idea of a college for males will naturally be
associated with that of a seminary, instituted and
endowed by the public; and the absurdity of sending
ladies to college may, at first thought, strike every
one to whom this subject shall be proposed. I therefore
hasten to observe that the seminary here recommended
will be as different from those appropriated
to the other sex as the female character and duties are
from the male. The business of the husbandman is
not to waste his endeavors in seeking to make his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
orchard attain the strength and majesty of his forest,
but to rear each to the perfection of its nature....</p>

<p>1. Females, by having their understandings
cultivated, their reasoning powers developed and
strengthened, may be expected to act more from the
dictates of reason, and less from those of fashion and
caprice.</p>

<p>2. With minds thus strengthened, they would be
taught systems of morality enforced by the sanctions
of religion; and they might be expected to acquire
juster and more enlightened views of their duty, and
stronger and higher motives in its performance.</p>

<p>3. This plan of education offers all that can be
done to preserve female youth from a contempt of
useful labor. The pupils would become accustomed
to it, in conjunction with the high objects of literature
and the elegant pursuits of the fine arts; and it
is to be hoped that both from habit and association
they might in future life regard it as respectable.</p>

<p>To this it may be added that if housekeeping
could be raised to a regular art, and taught from
philosophical principles, it would become a higher
and more interesting occupation; and ladies of fortune,
like wealthy agriculturists, might find that to
regulate their business was an agreeable employment.</p>

<p>4. The pupils might be expected to acquire a
taste for moral and intellectual pleasures which would
buoy them above a passion for show and parade, and
which would make them seek to gratify the natural
love of superiority by endeavoring to excel others in
intrinsic merit rather than in the extrinsic frivolities
of dress, furniture, and equipage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>By being enlightened in moral philosophy, and in
that which teaches the operation of the mind, females
would be enabled to perceive the nature and extent
of that influence which they possess over their children,
and the obligation which this lays them under
to watch the formation of their characters with unceasing
vigilance, to become their instructors, to devise
plans for their improvement, to weed out the
vices of their minds, and to implant and foster the
virtues. And surely there is that in the maternal
bosom which, when its pleadings shall be aided by
education, will overcome the seductions of wealth and
fashion, and will lead the mother to seek her happiness
in communing with her children, and promoting
their welfare, rather than in a heartless intercourse
with the votaries of fashion, especially when with
an expanded mind she extends her views to futurity,
and sees her care to her offspring rewarded by peace
of conscience, the blessing of her family, the prosperity
of her country, and, finally, with everlasting
pleasure to herself and them....</p>

<p>In calling on my patriotic countrymen to effect
so noble an object, the consideration of national glory
should not be overlooked. Ages have rolled away;
barbarians have trodden the weaker sex beneath their
feet; tyrants have robbed us of the present light of
heaven, and fain would take its future. Nations calling
themselves polite have made us the fancied idols
of a ridiculous worship, and we have repaid them with
ruin for their folly. But where is that wise and heroic
country which has considered that our rights are
sacred, though we cannot defend them? that, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
a weaker, we are an essential part of the body politic,
whose corruption or improvement must affect the
whole? and which, having thus considered, has sought
to give us by education that rank in the scale of being
to which our importance entitles us? History shows
not that country. It shows many whose legislatures
have sought to improve their various vegetable productions
and their breeds of useful brutes, but none
whose public councils have made it an object of their
deliberations to improve the character of their women.</p>

<h3>A Moral Crusade</h3>

<p class="author">By Elizabeth Blackwell</p>

<p class="intro">(One of the brilliant Blackwell family, to which progress in
our country owes so much. Henry Blackwell married Lucy Stone,
and with her became a pioneer advocate of woman suffrage. Elizabeth
took up the study of medicine, forcing the medical colleges to
open their doors to women. From her letters.)</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer of 1847, with my carefully
hoarded earnings, I resolved to seek an entrance into
a medical school. Philadelphia was then considered
the chief seat of medical learning in America, so to
Philadelphia I went; taking passage in a sailing vessel
from Charleston for the sake of economy....</p>

<p>Applications were cautiously but persistently
made to the four medical colleges of Philadelphia for
admission as a regular student. The interviews with
their various professors were by turns hopeful and
disappointing....</p>

<p>The fear of successful rivalry which at that time
often existed in the medical mind was expressed by
the dean of one of the smaller schools, who frankly
replied to the application, “You cannot expect us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
furnish you with a stick to break our heads with;”
so revolutionary seemed the attempt of a woman to
leave a subordinate position and seek to obtain a complete
medical education. A similarly mistaken notion
of the rapid practical success which would attend
a lady doctor was shown later by one of the
professors of my medical college, who was desirous of
entering into partnership with me on condition of
sharing profits over $5,000 on my first year’s practice.</p>

<p>During those fruitless efforts my kindly Quaker
adviser, whose private lectures I attended, said to me:
“Elizabeth, it is no use trying. Thee cannot gain
admission to these schools. Thee must go to Paris and
don masculine attire to gain the necessary knowledge.”
Curiously enough, this suggestion of disguise made
by good Dr. Warrington was also given me by Dr.
Pankhurst, the Professor of Surgery, in the largest
college in Philadelphia. He thoroughly approved of
a woman’s gaining complete medical knowledge; told
me that although my public entrance into the classes
was out of question, yet if I would assume masculine
attire and enter the college he could entirely rely on
two or three of his students to whom he should communicate
my disguise, who would watch the class and
give me timely notice to withdraw should my disguise
be suspected.</p>

<p>But neither the advice to go to Paris nor the suggestion
of disguise tempted me for the moment. It
was to my mind a moral crusade on which I had entered,
a course of justice and common sense, and it
might be pursued in the light of day, and with public
sanction, in order to accomplish its end.</p>

<h3>Intellectual Women of Rome</h3>

<p class="author">By Lady Morgan</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_17">See page 17</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Female amanuenses, or secretaries, or “writers
out of books,” were by no means unusual in Rome.
Vespasian had a female amanuesis, Antonio, whom he
greatly esteemed and confided in. Even the Christian
fathers adopted this fashion; and Eusebius asserts
that Origen had not only young men, but young
women to transcribe his books, which “they did with
peculiar neatness.” Among the accusations brought
against the Roman women of his own time by Juvenal,
is that of their learning; he bitterly attacks their presumption
in studying Greek, their interlarding even
their most familiar conversations with its elegant
idioms and phrases; and, among their other crimes
of acquirement, he further accuses them of encroaching
on the exclusive male prerogative of mind, by
discussing philosophical subjects, quoting favorite
authors and scholiasts, their <i>purism</i> in affected exactness
of grammar, and by their antiquarian researches
in language. On the word antiquarian, an ancient
commentator observes:—“Antiquaria, one that does
refine or preserve ancient books from corruption, one
studious of the old poets and historians, one that
studies ancient coins, statues, and inscribed stones:
lastly, such as use obsolete and antiquated words.
All which, though they might be counted an overplus
and curiosity in a woman, yet only the last is absolutely
a fault.”</p>

<h3>The Power of Education</h3>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_113">See page 113</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>That women should, however tardily, awaken to
a desire for greater intellectual light is of the utmost
promise. Education cannot confer genius, but it can
do an infinite work in the refinement, the strengthening,
and the enlightening of the mind; in the banishment
of prejudice, and in the correction of illogical
judgment. In view of the manifold superstitions, intolerances
and ignorances that prevail in the feminine
intelligence, and of the fearful influence which these
in turn bring to bear upon the children committed
in such numbers to their charge, no crusade that can
find favor with them, towards a New Jerusalem of
Culture, can be too early encouraged.</p>

<p>When the sweet faced New England woman,

some strong-minded man who could put her money to
some practical use. That vision realized has given
to hundreds of women ideals and standards which
have made life full and rich.</p>

<h3>Vocational Training for Girls</h3>

</div>

<p>Harvard was opened in 1636. Two hundred
years elapsed before there was any institution offering
corresponding advantages to girls....</p>

<p>If these women have always lagged in the rear
as increasing educational advantages of a literary or
professional character have been provided or procured
for boys, it is not strange, when, in reading
over the records of work on the few lines of industrial,
educational trade training and apprenticeship
we detect the same influences at work, sigh before the
same difficulties, and recognize the old, weary,
threadbare arguments too, which one would surely
think had been sufficiently disproved before to be at
least in this connection....</p>

<p>In such an age of transition as ours, any plan
of vocational training intended to include girls must
be a compromise with warring facts, and will therefore
have to face objections from both sides, from
those forward looking ones who feel that the domestic
side of woman’s activities is over emphasized,
and from those who still look back, who will fain refuse
to believe that the majority of women have to be
wage-earners for at least a part of their lives. These
latter argue that by affording to girls all the advantages
of industrial training, granted, or which may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
be granted to boys, we are “taking them out of the
home.” As if they were not out of the home already!</p>

<p>The reaction that women show today to their
educational freedom upsets a lot of the notions we
have inherited about the atmosphere of seclusion in

opportunity for women to share in the social stimulus
that men have found and prized in academic institutions.</p>

<p>The history of the education of women from the
early days, when to educate “shes” was viewed with
horror as an immoral proposition, to the present time
when more “shes” graduate from the high schools
than “hes”, is an interesting record in itself. Even
more significant, however, is the fact that both
“hes” and “shes” are educated largely by women in
the secondary schools which are the schools of “the
people.”</p>

<p>The habits of application, of concentration and

<p class="intro">(English contemporary. Author of “The Future of the

</div>

<p>All the world knows of the foundation of the
great modern career of sick-nursing; of the more bitter
and prolonged struggle of women to study medicine
and surgery and qualify as practitioners therein....
All these changes had, to a greater or less degree,
to be fought for by those who desired them....
People resisted them with more or less tenacity, and
used against the reformers the sort of arguments they
are still using against further emancipation....
There are, of course, some Orientalists, even in England,
who think in their hearts that it was a great
mistake to teach women to read. But most people
now accept the principle that women should have the
best education available, and only differ as to what
that education should be.</p>

<p>That this enlargement of the educational horizon

is that the advancing social and economic arrangements
of modern society will add continually to the
allotment to women of tasks and responsibilities unknown
to them in the past. Women will accept such
responsibilities in accordance with their ability and
training in competition with men, and their trained
intelligence will become year by year a more widely
recognized fact in the minds of University authorities
and in the adjustment and enlargement of curriculum
and University life.</p>

<h3>Democratization of Learning</h3>

<p class="author">By Charlotte J. Cipriani</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Teacher, writer on educational
problems. From “Elimination of Waste in Elementary Education,”
in “Education”—a monthly magazine.)</p>

</div>

<p>Two processes of “democratization” are conceivable
in the educational system of a nation; one
consists in lowering educational standards and aims
to the level that makes them readily acceptable and
accessible to the masses; the other consists in gradually
raising the intellectual level of the masses to
the level of high and efficient educational standards.
The admission of too early specialized “vocational
training” in a public school system has a dangerous
leaning towards the first process of democratization,
which is apt ultimately to defeat its own end. That
the second is of necessity a far lower and more
laborious one, does not invalidate its superiority.</p>

<h3>Educating the Daughter</h3>

<p class="author">By Josephine Pitcairn Knowles</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The Upholstered Cage.”)</p>

</div>

<p>The day has now arrived when nature and fairness
are proclaiming that the same expenditure of
time and money must be bestowed on the girl as on
the boy, and she should be regarded as an investment
in the same way as the boy now is. It has always
been realized that unless he is given a good education
and then started properly in life, that is, given a
“shove off,” as it were, he won’t do much, and so all
efforts in a family of small means are concentrated
toward helping launch the boy in life. The idea,
of course, being that he must support himself, and
very likely keep a wife and children, therefore it is
more important for him to get on well than for the
girl, who has her parents to keep her until she marries.
There would be nothing against this theory if it were
sound; but where the theory breaks down is that girls
and women now <i>do</i> have to earn their own living,
and this necessity is on the increase, and the point
is that the women have often to do it on inadequate
material; the girl earns <i>her</i> living <i>without</i> the previous
training, <i>without</i> the school or college training,
<i>without</i> any capital having been spent on her as a
premium, <i>without</i> all the advantages the boy started
with.</p>

although only one woman in one thousand goes to
college, even in the United States, where there are
more college women than in any other country, the
position of every individual woman in every part of
the civilized world has been changed because this one-tenth
of one percent. has proved beyond possibility
of question that in intellect there is no sex. Unwillingly
at first but inevitably and irresistably men have
admitted women into intellectual comradeship. The
opinions of educated women can no longer be ignored
by educated men.</p>

<h3>Social Education Important</h3>

<p class="author">By Helen Keller</p>

<p class="intro">(Helen Keller, having been born blind, deaf and dumb, is not
only remarkable in that she has mastered many things, including
articulate speech, but also that out of her reading and observations of
life, she is able to construct a philosophy obviously superior to that
of the average human being with normal faculties. The following
is from “The Modern Woman” in “The Metropolitan Magazine,”
October, 1912.)</p>

</div>

<p>Social ignorance is at the bottom of our miseries,
and if the function of education is to correct
ignorance, social education is at this hour the most
important kind of education.</p>

<p>The educated woman, then, is she who knows
the social basis of her life, and of the lives of those
whom she would help, her children, her employers,
her employees, the beggar at her door, and her congressman
at Washington....</p>

<p>It is for the American woman to know why
millions are shut out from the full benefits of such
education, art, and science as the race has thus far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
achieved. We women have to face questions that men
alone have evidently not been able to solve....</p>

<p>We must educate ourselves and that without
delay. We cannot wait longer for political economists
to solve such vital problems as clean streets, decent
houses, warm clothes, wholesome food, living wages,
safeguarded mines and factories, honest public
schools. These are our questions. Already women are
speaking and speaking nobly, and men are speaking
with us. To be sure, some men and some women are
speaking against us; but their contest is with the
spirit of life. Lot’s wife turned back; but she is an exception.
It is proverbial that women get what they
are bent on getting, and circumstances are driving
them toward education.</p>

bride. There!</p>

<p>HEDWIG (with a shrug): A breeding machine!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
(They all draw back). Why not call it what it is?
Speak the naked truth for once?</p>

<p class="center">...</p>

<p>HOFFMAN: That isn’t the question now. We
are going away—the best of us—to be shot, most
likely. Don’t you suppose we want to send some
part of ourselves into the future, since we can’t live
ourselves? There, that’s straight; and right, too.</p>

<p>HEDWIG: What I said—to breed a soldier for
the empire; to restock the land. (Fiercely). And
for what? For food for the next generation’s cannon.
Oh, it is an insult to our womanhood! You violate
all that makes marriage sacred! (Agitated, she walks
about the room). Are we women never to get up out
of the dust? You never asked us if we wanted this
war, yet you ask us to gather in the crops, cut the
wood, keep the world going, drudge and slave, and
wait, and agonize, lose our all, and go on bearing more
men—and more—to be shot down! If we breed the
men for you, why don’t you let us say what is to become
of them? Do we want them shot—the very
breath of our life?</p>

<p>HOFFMAN: It is for the fatherland.</p>

<p>HEDWIG: You use us, and use us,—dolls,
beasts of burden, and you expect us to bear it forever
dumbly; but I won’t! I shall cry out till I die.
And now you say it almost out loud, “Go and breed
for the empire.” War brides! Pah!</p>

to Amelia like that. She is the sweetest girl I have
seen for many a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>HEDWIG: What will happen to Amelia? Have
you thought of that? No; I warrant you haven’t.
Well, look. A few kisses and sweet words, the excitement
of the ceremony, the cheers of the crowd, some
days of living together,—I won’t call it marriage,
for Franz and I are the ones who know what real
marriage is, and how sacred it is,—then what? Before
you know it, an order to march. No husband to
wait with her, to watch over her. Think of her
anxiety if she learns to love you. What kind of a
child will it be? Look at me. What kind of a child
would I have, do you think? I can hardly breathe
for thinking of my Franz, waiting, never knowing
from minute to minute. From the way I feel, I
should think my child would be born mad, I’m that
wild with worrying. And then for Amelia to go
through the agony alone! No husband to help her
through the terrible hour. What solace can the state
give then? And after that, if you don’t come back,
who is going to earn the bread for her child? Struggle
and struggle to feed herself and her child; and
the fine-sounding name you trick us with—war-bride!
Humph! That will all be forgotten then. Only one
thing can make it worth while, and do you know what
that is? Love! Well struggle through fire and
water for that, but without it....</p>

in one of the Franco-Prussian battles, “Oh, well, we
will have another crop in twenty years!”</p>

<p>It is crops of men that governments depend upon.
At the outbreak of the war the military nations of
Europe took immediate steps to provide for the next
crop of soldiers. Before the ranks mobilized the seed
of warriors was sown. In Germany all soldiers were
urged to marry before leaving for the front. In many
churches hundreds of couples were married simultaneously
that no time might be lost. One of the
Emperor’s own sons set the example which thousands
of marriageable men immediately followed. In some
villages “holy matrimony” was recognized as the
equivalent of an engagement. Everywhere throughout
the fatherland distinctions between legitimate and
illegitimate have become indistinct. An illegitimate
son receives the support of the government. To bear
children for the fatherland is of greater virtue than
that they shall be born of wedlock, for thrones are
greater than altars and exigencies greater than ceremonies.</p>

this and do nothing. I offer my services as assistant
nurse at the American ambulance and am accepted....</p>

<p>On the second morning as I hurry down a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
hospital corridor I see a familiar face. A short, dark-haired,
dark-eyed young man is coming toward me.
He is one of the wounded and his right arm is gone.
His eye catches mine. He stops bewildered. Then
comes recognition. It is Zeni Peshkoff—Maxim
Gorki’s adopted son. Eight years ago when this man
was a boy I had known him in America. I grasp the
left hand, and my eyes drop before the empty right
sleeve. But Zeni Peshkoff is still gay, laughing Zeni.
He makes light of his trouble. Not until later do I
understand the terrible suffering there is from the
missing arm or realize how he struggles to use what
is not. Peshkoff had been in the trenches for months.
He had been through battles and bayonet charges and
escaped unhurt, but at last his day had come. A
bursting shell destroyed the right arm. He knew the
danger, and struggling to his feet, walked from the
battlefield. With the left hand he supported the
bleeding, broken right arm. As he stumbled back
past trenches full of German prisoners his plight was
so pitiful, his pluck so great, that instinctively these
men saluted. At the Place de Secours eight hundred
wounded had been brought in. There were accommodations
for one hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>All night young Peshkoff lay unattended, for
there were others worse hurt. Gangrene developed,
and he watched it spread from fingers to hand and
from hand to arm. In the morning a friendly lieutenant
noticed him. “There’s one chance,” he said,
“and that’s a hospital. If you can walk, come with
me.” Slowly young Peshkoff arose. Half fainting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
he dressed and went with the lieutenant—first by taxi
to the train and then twelve torturing hours to Paris.
As the hours passed the gangrene crept higher and
higher. The sick man grew giddy with fever. At
each station his carriage companions, fearing death,
wished to leave him upon the platform. But the
lieutenant was firm. The one chance for life was the
hospital. Finally, Paris was reached; a waiting ambulance
rushed him to the hospital. Immediately he
was taken to the operating room and the arm amputated.
A half hour more and his arm could not
have been saved. But this dramatic incident is only
one of many. The pluck of the average soldier is
unbelievable. Operations are accepted without question.
There are no protests—only the murmured
“<i>C’est la guerre, que voulez-vous</i>.”</p>

<p>I asked Zeni Peshkoff, Socialist, what his sensations
were when he went out to kill. “It didn’t seem
real, it doesn’t now. Before my last charge the lieutenant
and I were filled with the beauty of the night.
We sat gazing at the stars. Then the command came,
and we rushed forward. It did not seem possible I
was killing human beings.” It is this unreality that
sustains men. Germans are not human beings—only
the enemy. For the wounded French soldier will tell
you he loathes war and longs for peace. He fights for
one object—a permanent peace. He fights to save his
children from fighting.</p>

painfully, but nobly, of and for the future. Let us
interpret them for our children. Let us guard against
the hollow din which fills our streets today, when
cheap racial pride defeats humanity. In our children
we must have a pledge that this most fearful of all
wars is the last racial struggle. The blood of dead

what present need and future hope unite. It must be

<h3>The Early Morning Funeral</h3>

<p class="author">By Edna Elliott-Carr</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The Living Age.”)</p>

</div>

<p>One of the sad sights is the early morning funeral
to be met almost daily in the streets of Paris—the
lonely journey of a dead hero from his bed of suffering
to the Garden of Sleep.</p>

<p>One sunny morning as I turned from the wide
Champs Elysees into a side street, I found waiting
near the back entrance of a large hotel hospital a
small company of gendarmes with bowed heads, their
banner bearing the crêpe ribbons of mourning. Near
them a few passers-by were standing reverently looking
on. I waited. The hearse drove closer to the
door, and later bore away the coffin. No military
pomp or display! A splendid hero had given his life
for his country, and this was his simple funeral.
Above, on the window balconies, some maids stood
looking down, crying, and wiping their tears away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
with their aprons. This “colonel” had lain only four
days in the house of suffering, but in so short a time
had been beloved enough to be missed. The gendarmes
followed slowly, and in the rear a motor car bore a
military official. That was all!</p>

<p>The sun seemed to cease shining, and the world
looked cold and gray. A taxi cab hovered in sight.
I hailed it, and, entering, bade the driver accompany
the solemn cortage slowly. I had a sudden wish to
follow this soldier to his last resting place, and as I
did so, my thoughts were sad ones. How many thousands
of such deaths could this war already account
for, and how many thousands of hearts had it broken?</p>

<h3>Russian Women in Time of War</h3>

<p class="author">By Sarah Kropotkin-Lebedeff</p>

<p class="intro">(In “The Outlook” for October 21, 1914. Madame Lebedeff
is the daughter of the Russian Prince, Peter Kropotkin, known the
world over for his brilliant books, and his revolutionary ideas.)</p>

</div>

<p>It is not for nothing that the Russian peasant
woman is respected by her men and counted as their
equal in all labor. She plows and sows and reaps
with them, rising before the sun and ceasing work
only when the day fades. And the work she has to
undertake when her men have gone to war is no light
one. Each family has at least five or six acres to
cultivate. The pasture land the village holds is common.
It is usually the custom in time of stress for
the workers to do all the field work in common. At
three in the morning the women, and even the children,
turn out to work; at eleven they have a meal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
of dry black bread and perhaps a small cucumber.
Then, while the sun is high, they sleep; and from
four o’clock they work again, till sunset.... There
is other work for the women to do—shoeing horses,
mending plows, scythes, wheels, and so on. The
blacksmith has gone to the war, the wheelwright also;
so the peasant woman wields the hammer and sends
the chips flying with the ax. In the summer she fells
the trees and shears the sheep. And all the winter
she spins and weaves, waiting for her men to come
back, hoping always, and teaching her children to
love their country and their father, who has gone to
defend them against a strange foe.</p>

<h3>The Rising Value of a Baby</h3>

<p class="author">By Mabel Potter Daggett</p>

<p class="intro">(From “What the War Really Means to Women” in “Pictorial
Review.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Thus is explained quite simply over the world
to-day the rising value of a baby. Civilization is running
short in the supply of men. We don’t know
exactly how short. There are Red Cross returns that
say in the first six months alone of the war there were
2,146,000 men killed in battle and 1,150,000 more
seriously wounded. Figures, however, of cold statistics,
as always, may be challenged. There is a living
figure that may not be. See the woman in black all
over Europe, and to-morrow we shall meet her in
Broadway. There are so many of her in every belligerent
land over there that her crêpe veil flutters
across her country’s flag like the smoke that dims the
landscape in a factory town. It is the mourning
emblem of her grief, unmistakably symbolizing the
dark catastrophe of civilization that has signaled Parliaments
to assemble in important session. Population
is being killed off at such an appalling rate at the
front that the means for replacing it behind the lines
must be speeded up without delay. To-day registrar-generals
in every land, in white-faced panic, are scanning
the figures of the birth-rates that continue to
show steadily diminishing returns. And in every
house of government in the world, above all the debates
on aeroplanes and submarines and shipping and
shells, there is the rising alarm of another demand.
Fill the cradles! In the defense of the State, men
bear arms. It is women who must bear the armies.</p>

<h3>The Deserter</h3>

<p class="author">By Ellen N. LaMotte</p>

<p class="intro">(The story of the human wreckage of the battlefield, as witnessed
by an American hospital nurse a few miles behind the
French lines. From “The Backwash of War.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>When he could stand it no longer, he fired a
revolver up through the roof of his mouth, but he
made a mess of it. The ball tore out his left eye, and
then lodged somewhere under his skull, so they
bundled him into an ambulance and carried him,
cursing and screaming, to the nearest field hospital.
The journey was made in double quick time, over
rough Belgian roads. To save his life, he must reach
the hospital without delay, and if he was bounced to
death jolting along at break-neck speed, it did not
matter. That was understood. He was a deserter,
and discipline must be maintained. Since he had
failed on the job, his life must be saved, he must be
nursed back to health, until he was well enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
be stood up against a wall and shot. This is War.
Things like this also happen in peace time, but not so
obviously.</p>

<p>At the hospital he behaved abominably. The
ambulance men declared that he had tried to throw
himself out of the back of the ambulance, that he
had yelled and hurled himself about, and spat blood
all over the floor and blankets—in short, he was
very disagreeable. Upon the operating table he was
no more reasonable. He shouted and screamed and
threw himself from side to side, and it took a dozen
leather straps and four or five orderlies to hold him
in position, so that the surgeon could examine him.
During this commotion his left eye rolled about loosely
upon his cheek, and from his bleeding mouth he
shot great clots of stagnant blood, caring not where
they fell. One fell upon the immaculate white uniform
of the <i>Directrice</i>, and stained her from breast
to shoes. It was disgusting. They told him it was
<i>La Directrice</i>, and that he must be careful. For an
instant he stopped his raving, and regarded her
fixedly with his remaining eye, then took aim afresh,
and again covered her with his cowardly blood.
Truly it was disgusting.</p>

<p>To the <i>Medecin Major</i> it was incomprehensible,
and he said so. To attempt to kill oneself, when, in
these days, it was so easy to die in honour upon
the battlefield, was something he could not understand.
So the <i>Medecin Major</i> stood patiently aside,
his arms crossed, his supple fingers pulling the long
black hairs on his bare arms, waiting. He had long
to wait, for it was difficult to get the man under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
anesthetic. Many cans of ether were used, which
went to prove that the patient was a drinking man.
Whether he had acquired the habit of hard drink before
or since the war could not be ascertained; the
war had lasted a year now, and in that time many
habits may be formed. As the <i>Medecin Major</i> stood
there, patiently fingering the hairs on his hairy arms,
he calculated the amount of ether that was expended—five
cans of ether, at so many francs a can—however,
the ether was a donation from America, so it
did not matter. Even so, it was wasteful.</p>

<p>At last they said he was ready. He was quiet.
During his struggles he had broken out two big teeth
with the mouth gag, and that added a little more
blood to the blood already choking him. Then the
<i>Medecin Major</i> did a very skillful operation. He
trephined the skull, extracted the bullet that had
lodged beneath it, and bound back in place that erratic
eye. After which the man was sent back to the
ward, while the surgeon returned hungrily to his
dinner, long overdue. In the ward, he was a bad
patient. He insisted upon tearing off his bandages,
although they told him that this meant bleeding to
death. His mind seemed fixed on death. He seemed
to want to die, and was thoroughly unreasonable, although
quite conscious. All of which meant that he
required constant watching and was a perfect nuisance.
He was so different from the other patients,
who wanted to live. It was a joy to nurse them. By
expert surgery, by expert nursing, some of these were
to be returned to their homes again, <i>reformes</i>, mutilated
for life, a burden to themselves and to society;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
others were to be nursed back to health, to a point at
which they could again shoulder eighty pounds of
marching kit, and be torn to pieces again on the firing
lines. It was a pleasure to nurse such as these.
It called forth all one’s skill, all one’s humanity.
But to nurse back to health a man who was to be
court-martialled and shot, truly that was a dead-end
occupation....</p>

<p>Dawn filtered in through the little square windows
of the ward. Two of the patients rolled on
their sides, that they might talk to one another. In
the silence of early morning their voices rang clear.</p>

<p>“Dost thou know, <i>mon ami</i>, that when we captured
that German battery a few days ago, we found
gunners chained to their guns?”</p>

<h3>Two Sides of the Shield</h3>

<p class="author">By Princess Lazarovick-Hrebelianovich</p>

<p class="intro">(Nee, Eleanor Calhoun—Actress of American birth. From
an article in “Century Magazine.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Nowhere more than in London does the blazing
shield show a dark reverse. For, along with the
splendors of life, that ancient city brought me, too,
the first overwhelming sense of the world’s misery.
For sometime my life took me daily through a large
stretch of London. It seemed to me that I was
wandering through vast tides of woe. Age-long
tyrannies of ignorance and vice and suffering have
welded a fixity of type in the flesh, binding enormous
segregations into more or less uniform kinds of
peoples. The misery-sodden “lower classes,” as I
heard them called, seemed narrowed and fixed and
starved and warped forever. The “lower middle
classes” gave the impression of being jammed in
between walls from above and below, as if all broad
or wholesome feeling, or generous enjoyment of
beauty were kept from penetrating to them or
issuing from them. The “upper middle classes” and
the “higher classes” appeared to look with horror
upon any real contact with the others, while intermarrying
with them was impossible.... It was the
vast crowds of the others, “the wholesale lot”, that
reflected their discouragement in my mind.</p>

<h3>Outcasts</h3>

<p class="author">By Eleanor Wentworth</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The International Socialist Review.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Outside the Rotunda of the Fine Arts Building
of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition is
hunched a gripping, sorrowful figure—a figure that
crouches back amidst the foliage as if humbly
seeking to escape the eye of the passer. Meekly it
bears the name of <i>Outcast</i>. About it, fountains
ripple; beyond, the sun joyfully sets agleam the
somber greens of olive; chuckling, sprightly Pans,
with uptilted pipes, laugh to scorn the chill atmosphere
of the sorrowful one, set so far into the
shadows that the sun never reaches it, leaving its
marble surface ghastly.</p>

<p>The figure, with arms clenched and head bowed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
in its shadow seclusion indomitably symbolizes the
disowned of the ages—the iron-collared slave, the
branded thief, the wandering disbeliever, the woman
scorned, the helpless debtor. It symbolizes those
passive sufferers, who, after tilling and sowing the
fields of life, so that they grow green and cool,
wander begrimed and thirsty in the waste desert
stretches. Pitifully it speaks of those who confidently
threw their heart’s sweetest flowers in the
world they loved, receiving no return, living forevermore
with barren hopes. It whispers of those
who flung their cries of joy to the winds, and heard
them wafted back as taunts. It speaks of builders,
of whose dream houses no cornerstone or cornice
has been realized. Voicelessly it proclaims the
<i>Slave of the Past</i>.</p>

<p>And as I looked at it, so hopelessly resigned, I
hated it, for all its powerful symbolism.</p>

<p>Did the world know no other Outcast than this
shrinking, unreproachful figure? Was this symbolism
the whole truth? Were there no Outcasts who
dared accuse?—who dared fight for their inheritance?
None to cry dauntlessly, “We will not be
cast aside, we who have builded and tilled and
dreamed!” Were there no outcasts with hope—with
fighting blood?</p>

<p>In the far recesses of the Japanese Section,
where only a few errant footfalls echo solemnly
through the spacious silence, I found that for which
I searched. There I found the symbol of the Outcast
I dared hope to see. A truly courageous figure it is,
with Hope and the Spirit to be Free stamped large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
upon it. It is the very antithesis of that bowed
figure out among the green vines and laughing Pans,
which seem to beg forgiveness for its very existence.
This other figure is called “Strike”, and proudly it
bears its insignia of rebellion. The gaunt outlines
and the eyes overshadowed with a terrible fatigue
brand this figure of a man, as the other, with the
marks of the Outcast. A woman leans upon him,
and in turn, a brood of young cling to her skirts.
But this Outcast is no craven. He neither cringes
nor sorrows. He stands erect, and through the
shadows of fatigue, his eyes flash defiance out upon
the world of the Self-Satisfied. He seems to cry
aloud:</p>

<p>“I suffer, my mate suffers, and our young; but
you shall pay—pay in full! You who stand between
us and our inheritance, your time is drawing near—prepare!
For we declare that we, too, shall live, we,
the sufferers!”</p>

<p>This Outcast, springing from the depths, flings
a challenge where others have only wept; dares
where others have cowered in self-debasement.
This man of courage, standing erect under the
scourges of suffering and deprivation, gazing so
steadfastly into the Beyond through overshadowed
eyes—he dares aspire to walk in the green fields of
his making; already he treads them in his imagination.
He has sent a barely whispered hope of joy
out upon the winds and it is rushing back to him a
mighty symphony of realization. He dreams of a
beautiful world, and builds it as he dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>He heralds the day when there will be no Outcasts,
but all will be Well-Beloved.</p>

<p>He is the <i>Master of the Future</i>.</p>

<h3>Servitude</h3>

<p class="author">By Maria Montessori</p>

<p class="intro-c">(Quoted from “The Larger Aspect of Socialism,” by Walling.)</p>

</div>

<p>Any nation that accepts the idea of servitude
and believes that it is an advantage for man to be
served by man admits servility as an instinct, and
indeed we all too easily lend ourselves to obsequious
service, giving to it such complimentary names as
courtesy, politeness, charity.</p>

<p>In reality, he who is served is limited in his
independence. This concept will be the foundation
of the dignity of the man of the future; “I do not
wish to be served because I am not impotent.”
And this idea must be gained before men can feel
themselves to be really free.</p>

<h3>Factories Instead of Homes</h3>

<p class="author">By Mary E. McDowell</p>

<p class="intro">(Head of University Settlement House, Chicago. Writer and
speaker for suffrage, organized labor, etc.)</p>

</div>

<p>However earnestly we may deplore the fact
that women are in factories instead of homes, we
must squarely face conditions as they exist. There
are hundreds of thousands of helpless, untrained,
unorganized women without the power of legislating
for themselves, who are forced by the stress of circumstances
to earn their livelihood, and it is of
vital importance that they be given the chance to be
decently self-supporting under conditions which will
unfit them for wifehood and motherhood and the
care of the homes.</p>

<h3>The Voteless Sex</h3>

<p class="author">By Meta L. Stern</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary journalist and speaker. From a leaflet
on Suffrage.)</p>

</div>

<p>Thousands of women today are working under
conditions unfit for human beings. At unguarded
machinery they are risking their nimble fingers, the
only source of income they possess. In firetrap
buildings they are risking their lives. Badly ventilated
workrooms, filled with particles of flying dust,
weaken their lungs and make them susceptible to
tuberculosis. Long working hours sap their strength
and vitality. Dangerous occupations make them
physical wrecks in a few years and render them unfit
for wifehood and motherhood. In the case of
married women workers an appalling infant mortality
is a concomitant of women’s labor. But with all
these sacrifices even the woman who performs a
man’s work does not get a man’s wages. Everywhere
we find unequal pay for equal work. The
voteless sex is cheap.</p>

</div>

<p>Look about you; the products of labor are on
every hand; you could not maintain for a moment a
well-ordered life without them; every object in
your room has in it, for discerning eyes, the mark of
ingenious tools and the pressure of labor’s hands.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
But is it not the cruelest injustice for the wealthy,
whose lives are surrounded and embellished by
labor’s work, to have a superabundance of the
money which represents the aggregate of labor in
any country, while the laborer himself is kept so
steadily at work that he has no time to acquire the
education and refinements of life that would make
him and his family agreeable companions to the
rich and cultured?...</p>

<p>I believe that competition is doomed. The trust,
whose single object is to abolish competition, has
proved that we are better without it, than with it, and
the moment corporations control the supply of any
product, they combine. What the Socialist desires is
that the corporation of humanity should control all
production. Beloved comrades, this is the frictionless
way; it is the higher way; it eliminates the motives
for a selfish life; it enacts into our every-day living
the ethics of Christ’s gospel. Nothing else will do it;
nothing else can bring the glad day of universal
brotherhood.</p>

<h3>Working Girls Must Cooperate</h3>

<p class="author">By Pauline M. Newman</p>

<p class="intro">(Organizer of working women. Former organizer for the International
Garment Workers’ Union. In “Life and Labor.”)</p>

</div>

<p>All those who work are aware of the fact that
conditions today—insofar as the working girl is concerned—are
not what they should be....</p>

<p>Now, what is wrong? To begin with, the work
day is too long, the wages are too low. Good sanitary
conditions are a rarity. Laws to protect the lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
of women and children workers are scarce—in reality....
There are enough laws on the statute books, but
very few are enforced. Labor laws intended to protect
women are constantly being violated. Why?
Simply because the women have, thus far, failed to
cooperate with one another in order to enforce them.</p>

<p>Nearly eight million working women are subjected
to the conditions described above. According
to investigators—the writer of these lines having been
one of these—the average wage of these women does
not exceed seven dollars a week. A wage <i>proven</i> insufficient
to live on. Such wages shape the lives of
the women, and those dependent upon them. What
kind of a life, then, can they lead? A life which is
a mere existence, that is all. Because they are compelled
to do so, they substitute cheap amusement for
something more refined. They live on a five-cent
breakfast, ten-cent lunch, and a twenty-cent dinner;
live in a dingy room without air and without comfort;
wear clothes of cheap material, trying hard to imitate
those who are more fortunate than they. Their whole
life is cheap from beginning to end. Deprived of sunshine
and fresh air, no time for recreation, no time
for rest, they have only time for <i>work</i>.</p>

<p>At present women are the most enslaved part of
the human race. They are paid lower wages even
than the average working man. When they are not
in the wage market as industrial workers, or clerks
or civil servants, then they are usually in the unsatisfactory
position of being a wife who is, economically
speaking, a dependent on the wishes and purse of her
father or husband. They may work all day at the
management of the children and the home—much
harder often, than the worker in the factory—but in
return these wives and mothers do not get, in the
ordinary case, a fixed salary or wage which they can
call their own. Neither are the working hours of the
wife and mother fixed, as even in the case of factory
workers. There is in the life of the housewife of the
manual laboring class scarcely an hour a day when
she is entirely free to go where she pleases or do what
she pleases. The woman who has not a private income
of her own is, in the general case, the economic dependent
of the man, and in that class is the large
majority of my sex.</p>

<h3>Moses, the Strike Leader</h3>

<p class="author">By Frances Squire Potter</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Professor of English in the University
of Minnesota. Writer and speaker on labor and political
problems. Corresponding Secretary of the National American
Woman’s Suffrage Association, author “The Ballingtons,” etc. Died
March, 1914. In “Life and Labor.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Out of the waters of the Nile, Pharaoh’s
daughter drew a Hebrew babe, condemned to die.
As her adopted son, he was taught at court all the
wisdom of the Egyptians. As an Egyptian prince he
might have lived and died in splendor, and his gold-cased
mummy might have been on some museum
shelf today, a dead curiosity. An aristocrat, a
lawyer, a capitalist—these are what he was brought
up to be.</p>

<p>Egypt was in the full afternoon of her grandeur.
A Pharoah was on the throne whose soul was filled
with the ambition to build palaces and temples and
cities such as the world had never seen. His heavy
hand fell upon the free Hebrews in his kingdom, and
sent them to the quarries and the brick-yards to toil
with slaves under the lash of merciless foreman. And
as his cities and monuments grew, he became drunk
with his own glory, and the slaves were flogged to ever
more inhuman exertions in the quarries.</p>

<p>“And it came to pass in those days, when Moses
was grown up, that he went out to his brethren, and
looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian
smiting an Hebrew. And he looked this way, and
that way, and when he saw that there was no man,
he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.”</p>

<p>I do not believe this was the first time he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
walked abroad to view his brother slaves toiling.
His wrath had been long smouldering in him. You
notice he did not attack the Egyptian with blind
rage. “He looked this way and that”, and when he
saw he was unobserved he deliberately slew the
oppressor and buried the body in the desert sands.</p>

<p>Thus the greatest law-giver in history began his
career by committing the greatest crime known to
the law. He was not young. He was forty years of
age. He became a law-breaker only because the laws
of Egypt no longer protected the man who worked
from the tyrant who confiscated his labor. His soul
was in rebellion against “the system”.</p>

<p>How did the workers take this “direct action”?
Just as the workers of today would. When he went
back the next day, instead of being greeted as a deliverer,
he was repudiated by the Hebrews. They
were justly suspicious of a member of the system
who eased his conscience for a living in the royal
family by killing a brutal foreman. “Who made thee
a prince and a judge over us?” was a very pertinent
question. Who, indeed, but Pharoah himself?</p>

<p>But Pharoah on his part was deeply incensed at
this rebel in his own family and Moses fled for his
life into the deserts of Arabia, carrying with him the
consciousness of having made his brethren’s lot
worse by his blundering attempt to mend it....</p>

<p>At last, amid the frowning precipices and lonely
crags of Mount Sinai, the cry of his race became too
strong for him to resist.... And so Moses turns his
face once more toward the Nile country, and the
great moment of his life is upon him.... From now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
on the magnificent story represents the struggle of
the enslaved Hebrews for freedom as a duel between
two men—Pharoah on the throne, and Moses, the
desert wanderer. The one stands for entrenched
tyranny, the other is a strike leader. Behind Pharoah
is all the power of Egypt, upheld by the armies of the
empire. Behind Moses is the mysterious pillar of
cloud and of fire—the destiny of the race. Between
these two colossi cower the race of slaves whose destiny
is at hand....</p>

<p>Just as the Pharoahs of the Colorado coal fields
are doing today, Pharoah of Egypt hardened his
heart, until the climax of the struggle came in his
cry of rage, “Get thee from me, take heed to thyself,
see my face no more: for in the day thou seest
my face, thou shalt die!” And Moses said, “Thou
hast spoken well, I will see thy face no more.” ...</p>

<p>So Moses leads his people out into the wilderness
of freedom....</p>

<p>Years passed, and the wilderness was whitened
with the bones of the slaves, whose free-born children
grew up to higher manhood under their aged
leader’s constant counsels and warnings. At last
the time came when they were fit to take a place
among the nations of the earth, and the pillar of fire
and of cloud turns and drifts toward Canaan.</p>

<p>With what longing the old man’s heart looked
toward the land of promise, the first fixed abiding
place life seemed to offer, we can gather from his
own confession. But it was not to be. His course
was run. He was a strike leader, a nation-molder,
a law-giver, not a military conqueror. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
tribes reach the desert and look down into the green
valley of the Jordan, they are called together to
hear his parting words. On the slopes of Mount
Nebo in the land of Moab, after the antiphonal
chanting of the blessings and curses, and the sounding
of the trumpets of the Levites, the dying leader
stands for the last time before his people, delivers
the matchless farewell address recorded in Deuteronomy,
blesses them, and passes from their sight
forever, up into the solitude of the mountain
peaks....</p>

<p>“And the children of Israel wept for Moses in
the plains of Moab, but no man knoweth of his sepulchre
unto this day. And there hath not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like unto Moses....”</p>

<h3>Class Legislation</h3>

<p class="author">By M. Carey Thomas</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_10">See page 10</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>In the past we have no single instance of any
class of men with the ballot legislating fairly for any
other class of men without the ballot. How then can
the men of the world all working and all voting protect
the special interests of the voteless women of the
world who are emerging as workers millions strong
on the surface of our human bee-hive? They cannot.
If they have in the past done injustice to the disfranchised
classes of their fellow men, they will do far
more terrible injustice in the future to disfranchised
classes of working women. If the vote has been indispensable
as a protection in the past, it will be still
more indispensable in the future because modern socialistic
legislation will increasingly control employers
and employed. Thousands of English women are to-day
banded together in their suffrage unions demanding
with desperate courage from a reluctant parliament
a vote to protect their labor and their children
for whom they labor.</p>

<p>Other movements toward freedom have aimed at

less than raising the status of an entire sex—half of

<p>Women are notoriously the poor sex. Even a
woman who figures as a rich woman is often merely an

<h3>Breaking Up in Violence</h3>

</div>

<p>There must be a check on the ever-widening inequality
between the richest and the poorest, or our
social structure will not endure; we shall have revolution,
not evolution; cataclysm, not growth.... In
some of the old world countries the inequality is of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
such long growth that one can hardly imagine its
breaking up without violence. With us it is not yet
adamantine. Pray God it never may be.</p>

<p>Their cause is my cause. If they are denied a
living wage, I also am defrauded. While they are industrial
slaves, I cannot be free. My hunger is not
satisfied while they are unfed. I cannot enjoy the
good things of life which come to me, if they are hindered
and neglected. I want all the workers of the
world to have sufficient money to provide the elements
of a normal standard of living—a decent home,
healthful surroundings, opportunity for education
and recreation. I want them to have the same blessings
I have. I, deaf and blind, have been helped to
overcome many obstacles. I want them to be helped
as generously in a struggle which resembles my own
in many ways.</p>

<p>Surely the things that the workers demand are
not unreasonable. It cannot be unreasonable to ask
of society a fair chance for all.... Until the spirit of
love for our fellow men, regardless of race, color or
creed, shall fill the world, making real in our lives and
our deeds the actuality of human brotherhood—until
the great mass of the people shall be filled with the
sense of responsibility for each other’s welfare, social
injustice can never be attained.</p>

<h3>Women’s Labor Organizations</h3>

<p class="author">By Ida Tarbell</p>

<p class="intro">(American contemporary. Author of “History of Standard
Oil,” “The Business of Being a Woman,” etc.)</p>

</div>

<p>Already there are signs that the woman’s labor
organizations are willing to recognize the inherent
dignity of household service—and this is as it should
be. The woman who labors should be the one to recognize
that all labor is per se equally honorable—that
there is no stigma in honestly performed, useful service.</p>

<p>If she is to bring to the labor world the regeneration
she dreams, she must begin not by saying that the
shop girl, the clerk, the teacher, are in a higher class
than the cook, the waitress, the maid, but that we are
all laborers alike, sisters by virtue of the service we
are rendering society. That is, labor should be the
last to recognize the canker in the caste.</p>

<h3>Abolish “Dependent Classes”</h3>

<p class="author">By Josephine Shaw Lowell</p>

<p class="intro">(Quoted from “The Survey.” Mrs. Charles Russell Lowell.
Mrs. Lowell served 13 years as Charity Commissioner in New
York, and in many other ways was engaged in all good causes,
municipal as well as philanthropic.)</p>

</div>

<p>I object to the term “dependent classes,” unless
in speaking of the insane. That such a class, not included
among the insane, does exist among us is a fact;
in more than one county of this great, rich state,
there are families, as you know, who for five generations
have been more or less dependent on their fellow
citizens and such families constitute a class; but yet
I protest against the use of this phrase in a way to
suggest that the existence of such a class should be
recognized except to be abolished.</p>

<p>There will always be <i>persons</i> who must be helped,
<i>individuals</i> who must depend upon public relief or
on private charity for maintenance, it is true, but it
is a disgrace to any community to have a dependent
<i>class</i>, and the fact of its existence is a proof that the
community has done its duty neither to those who
compose it, nor to those who maintain it.</p>

<h3>The Servant Class</h3>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_71">See page 71</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Women are thinking at last, not in men’s terms,
but in their own, and that in a slave class is always
dynamic.... Because it has vision where the other
has archaism, the “lower class” is become the higher
class, self-conscious and self-poised. Not only youth,
but childhood, is rebel. Art has become anarchic, and
as mysteriously as Nature works everywhere, so has
she worked with the servant half of the human race,
stirring it to self-consciousness and action; helping to
keep alive the tiny torch of revolt.</p>

<h3>The Revolutionist</h3>

<p class="author">By Catherine Breshkovskaya</p>

<p class="intro">(Born to luxury, but casting her lot, when only twenty-six,
with the group of revolutionists who dared hope that the Russian
peasantry might some day arise and rebel against the horrible oppression
of the government. Twice exiled to Siberia, escaping once
after serving a sentence of twenty-one years. Just before the overthrow
of the czar closely guarded in a Siberian prison cell, after a
second attempt to escape. Free once more, she has lived to see
part of the realization of her dreams, the overthrow of Imperialism.)</p>

</div>

<p>We put on peasant dress, to elude the police and
break down the peasant’s cringing distrust. I dressed
in enormous bark shoes, coarse shirt and drawers, and
heavy cloak. I used acid on my face and hands; I
worked and ate with the peasants; I learned their
speech; I travelled on foot, forging passports. I
lived ‘illegally!’</p>

<p>By night I did my organizing. You desire a picture?
A low room with mud floors and walls. Rafters
just overhead, and still higher thatch. The room was
packed with men, women and children. Two big fellows
sat up on the high brick stove, with their dangling
feet knocking occasional applause. These people
had been gathered by my host, a brave peasant whom
I picked out, and he in turn had chosen only those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
whom Siberia could not terrify. I now recalled their
floggings; I pointed to those who were crippled for
life; to women, whose husbands died under the lash;
and when asked if men were to be forever flogged,
then they would cry out so fiercely that the three or
four cattle in the next room would bellow and have
to be quieted. Again I would ask what chances their
babies had of living, and in reply some peasant woman
would tell how her baby had died the winter before.
Why? I asked. Because they had only the
most wretched strips of land. To be free and live,
the people must own the land! From my cloak I
would bring a book of fables written to teach our
principles and stir the love of freedom. And then far
into the night, the firelight showed a circle of great,
broad faces and dilated eyes, staring with all the reverence
every peasant has for that mysterious thing—a
book.</p>

<p>These books, twice as effective as oral work, were
printed in secrecy at heavy expense. But many of
us had libraries, jewels, costly gowns and furs to sell;
and new recruits kept adding to our fund. We had
no personal expenses....</p>

<p>In that year of 1874, over two thousand educated
people traveled among the peasants. Weary work,
you say. Yes, when the peasants were slow and dull
and the spirit of freedom seemed an illusion. But
when that spirit grew real one felt far from weary....</p>

<p>We may die in exile, and our children may die in
exile, and our children’s children may die in exile,
but something must come of it at last.</p>

<h3>Our New Aristocracy</h3>

<p class="author">By Gertrude Atherton</p>

<p class="intro-c">(From “The New Aristocracy,” in “The Cosmopolitan.”)</p>

<p class="intro-c">(<a href="#Page_44">See page 44</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Instead of laying away their sense of social supremacy
in old rose and lavendar, our new aristocracy
of wealth is often haughty and frigid in manner, and
not only ostentatious in expenditure, but arrogantly
assertive of what it believes to be its superior rights
... frivolity, selfishness and pride and the constant
exercise of these qualities hardens what, for convenience,
we call the heart, and breeds indifference for the
feelings and rights of others. I have been interviewed
by women reporters in almost every country I have
visited, and it is only in America—in New York, to
be exact—that they have spoken of their dread of approaching
fashionable or merely rich, women....
Those we have of ancient lineage,—who have framed
their family tree and proved their seven generations,
whose fortunes have kept pace with the times, and
who from the somewhat attenuated backbone of society,
in New York, for instance—are more objectionable
in some respects, than the new-rich. While they
ought to know better, they are so uneasily conscious of
their position as real aristocrats in a country too large
to give them a universal recognition, that anxious
pride has bleached their very blood, attenuated their
features, narrowed their lips, and practically deprived
them of any distinctive personalities, the best that
can be said of them is that they are not, with one
notorious exception, vulgar in the common use of
the word.</p>

<h3>Two Storks</h3>

<p class="author">By Charlotte Perkins Gilman</p>

<p class="intro">(America’s foremost woman Sociologist. Author of numerous
books, and editor, owner and publisher of “The Forerunner,” a
magazine of advanced thought on the woman question. The following
is from “The Forerunner.”)</p>

</div>

<p>Two storks were nesting.</p>

<p>He was a young stork—and narrow minded. Before
he married he had consorted mainly with striplings
of his own kind, and had given no thought to the
ladies, either maid or matron.</p>

<p>After he married his attention was concentrated
on his all-satisfying wife, upon that triumph of art,
labor and love—their nest, and upon those special
creations—their children. Deeply was he moved by
the marvelous instincts and processes of motherhood.
Love, reverence, intense admiration, rose in his
heart for her of the well-built nest; her of the gleaming
treasure of smooth eggs; her of the patient brooding
breast, the warming wings, the downy, wide-mouthed
group of little ones.</p>

<p>Assiduously he labored to help her build the nest,
to help her feed the young; proud of his impassioned
activity in her and their behalf; devoutly he performed
his share of the brooding, while she hunted in
her turn. When he was a-wing he thought continually
of her as one with the brood—his brood. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
he was on the nest he thought all the more of her,
who sat there so long, so lovingly, to such noble ends.</p>

<p>The happy days flew by, fair spring—sweet summer—gentle
autumn. The young ones grew larger
and larger; it was more and more work to keep their
lengthening, widening beaks shut in contentment.
Both parents flew far afield to feed them.</p>

<p>Then the days grew shorter, the sky grayer, the
wind colder; there was large hunting and small success.
In his dreams he began to see sunshine, broad,
burning sunshine, day after day; skies of limitless
blue; dark, deep, yet full of fire; stretches of bright
water, shallow, warm—fringed with tall reeds and
rushes, teeming with fat frogs.</p>

<p>They were in her dreams, too, but he did not
know that.</p>

<p>He stretched his wings and flew farther every
day; but his wings were not satisfied. In his dreams
came a sense of vast heights and boundless spaces of
the earth streaming away beneath him; black water
and white land; gray water and brown land, blue
water and green land, all flowing backward from day
to day, while the cold lessened and the warmth grew.</p>

<p>He felt the empty sparkling nights, stars far
above, quivering, burning; stars far below quivering
more in the dark water; and felt his great wings wide,
strong, all-sufficient, carrying him on and on!</p>

<p>This was in her dreams, too, but he did not know
that.</p>

<p>“It is time to go,” he cried one day. “They are
coming! It is upon us! Yes,—I must go! Goodbye,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
my wife! Goodbye, my children!” For the passion
of wings was upon him.</p>

<p>She, too, was stirred to the heart. “Yes, it is
time to go!” she cried. “I am ready! Come!”</p>

<p>He was shocked, grieved, astonished. “Why, my
dear!” he said, “How preposterous! You cannot go
on the great flight! Your wings are for brooding
tender little ones! Your body is for the wonder of the
gleaming treasure.—Not for days’ and nights’ ceaseless
soaring! You cannot go!”</p>

<p>She did not heed him. She spread her wide
wings and swept and circled far and high above,—as,
in truth, she had been doing for many days, though
he had not noticed it.</p>

<p>She dropped to the ridge pole beside him, where
he was still muttering objections. “Is it not glorious?”
she cried. “Come! They are nearly ready!”</p>

<p>“You unnatural mother!” he burst forth. “You
have forgotten the order of nature! You have forgotten
your children! Your lovely, precious, tender,
helpless little ones!” And he wept, for his highest
ideals were shattered.</p>

<p>But the precious little ones stood there on the
ridge pole and flapped their strong young wings in
high derision. They were as big as he was, nearly;
for as a matter of fact, he was but a young stork
himself.</p>

<p>Then the air was beaten white with a thousand
wings; it was like snow and silver and sea-foam;
there was a flash, a whirlwind, a hurricane of wild
joy and then the army of the sky spread wide in due
array and streamed southward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>Full of remembered joy and more joyous hope,
finding the sunlight better than her dreams, she swept
away to the far summerland; and her children, mad
with the happiness of the first flight, swept beside her.</p>

<p>“But you are a mother!” he panted, as he caught
up with them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she cried, joyously, “but I was a stork
before I was a mother! and afterward!—and all the
time!”</p>

<p>And the storks were flying.</p>

<h3>Dress Reform</h3>

<p class="author">By Amelia Bloomer</p>

<p class="intro">(Editor of “The Lily.” An advocate in the ’50s, of dress
reform. Introduced the bifurcated skirt which popular acclaim at
once called “The Bloomer.” A woman personally modest, who suffered
because of the sneers and attacks at her efforts to have women
dress sensibly. From “Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony.”)</p>

</div>

<p>I feel that if all of us were less slaves to fashion
we would be nobler women, for both our bodies and
minds are now rendered weak and useless from the
unhealthy and barbarous style of dress adopted, and
from the time and thought in making it attractive. A
change is demanded and if I have been the means of
calling the attention of the public to it and of leading
only a few to disregard old customs and for once to
think and act for themselves, I shall not trouble myself
about the false imputations that may be cast upon
me.</p>

<h3>Women Run in Molds</h3>

<p class="author">By Frances Power Cobb</p>

<p class="intro">(From “Woman’s Work and Woman’s Culture,” a compilation
of essays published in 1869, in London.)</p>

</div>

<p>Of all the theories current concerning women,
none is more curious than the theory that it is needful
to make a theory about them. That a woman is a
Domestic, a Social, or a Political creature; that she is
a Goddess, or a Doll; the “Angel in the House,” or a
Drudge, with a suckling of fools and a chronicaling of
small beer for her sole privileges that she has, at all
events, a “Mission,” or a “Sphere,” or a “Kingdom,”
of some sort or other, if we could but agree on
what it is,—all this is taken for granted. But, as nobody
ever yet sat down and constructed analogous
hypotheses about the other half of the human race, we
are driven to conclude, both that a woman is a more
mysterious creature than a man, and also that it is the
general impression that she is made of some more
plastic material, which can be advantageously manipulated
to fit our theory about her nature and office,
whenever we have come to a conclusion as to what that
nature and office may be. “Let us fix our own Ideal
in the first place,” seems to be the popular notion,
and then the real Woman in accordance thereto will
appear in due course of time. We have nothing to do
but to make round holes and women will grow round
to fill them; or square holes, and they will become
square. Men grow like trees, and the most we can
do is to lop or clip them, but women run in molds,
like candles, and we can make them long-threes, or
short-sixes, whichever we please.</p>

<p>The best things of our nature fashion themselves
in silence.</p>

<p>Life’s just a perpetual piecing together.</p>

<p class="author">By Agnes H. Downing</p>

<p class="intro-c">(In “The Progressive Woman.”)</p>

<p>The woman is censured with the idea of protecting
morality. And the man is let go; why? Nobody
knows why. Because he is a man and no one ever
thought of punishing a man for a little thing like
that.... Would you avoid tragedies? Then advocate
sex-equality. We will always have individual and
social tragedy so long as the woman is stoned and the
man goes free.</p>
